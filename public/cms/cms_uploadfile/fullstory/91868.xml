      <description>&lt;div&gt;Publicis Groupe&amp;nbsp;has been selected to handle the creative, media and social duties of Cathay Pacific. Leo&amp;nbsp;Burnett will lead the mandate in India. The development has been confirmed by highly placed sources&amp;nbsp;in the agency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The announcement has been made following a global review, which began in March.
