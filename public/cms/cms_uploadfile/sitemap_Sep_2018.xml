      <news:title>Myntra launches digital campaign to promote its loyalty programme ‘Myntra Insider’</news:title>
      <news:description>Myntra has announced the launch of its loyalty programme, Myntra Insider. A first-of-its kind in the country, the programme is a comprehensive package, designed to strengthen engagement with its users to drive stickiness on the platform. This open-to-all programme allows Myntra to democratise fashion for every registered user through unique rewards and experiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Myntra Insider programme hinges on three pillars - it rewards members for purchases as well as engagement such as browsing new categories, sharing feedback,and wish listing. It offers a host of exciting perks across fashion and lifestyle, with offers from sellers on Myntra and lifestyle partners such as Zomato, TataSky, BigBasket, PhonePe, BookMyShow, EROS NOW, Zoom Car and&amp;nbsp;Gaana, among others. Men and women Insiders will be able to avail special privileges such as early access to sales, priority customer support, special birthday offers and more, depending on their Insider level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on their level of fandom, users are categorised to be either, Insider, Select, Elite or Icon, with each level offering greater benefits and privileges over the previous.

The highlight of the campaign is a 45 second promotional film starring Rhea Chakraborty, showcasing the various facets of the program by outlining the perks in store for a Myntra Insider. It gracefully captures the essence of the unique perks by chronicling the merriments of a young woman, wooed by Myntra’s latest loyalty proposition.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Viewers witness the young woman ushered into the programme through a metaphorical royal welcome, where she is offered a crown, followed by a series of entitlements that she enjoys as part of her newfound status. They include, an exclusive dining experience, access to her favorite entertainment programme on an over-the-top media service provider and a free makeover session with a personal stylist. A vocal narration sums it up with three words, PERKS, PRIVILEGES and PRIDE, after a young man is seen receiving the invitation to be an insider. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the video:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Honda unveils latest campaign ‘Sau mein se sava sau’ for Activa 125</news:title>
      <news:description>Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Pvt. Ltd. has launched its latest campaign - “Sau mein se sava sau” for the new Activa 125. The campaign is conceptualised by Dentsu One, a Dentsu Aegis Network division.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 2018 edition of Activa 125 comes equipped with LED headlamp, LED position lamp and 4-in-1 lock with seat opening switch. Building on trust of more than a million customers, Activa 125 offers solid power, strong (metal body) and blend of performance, efficiency, comfort with advanced features.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign aims to promote new class leading features of Activa 125 while leveraging the trust and legacy of brand Activa. Positioned as the preferred choice in its category, it combines the reliability of Activa with power of 125cc engine and stylish solid metal body with a frontastic chrome stance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking a slice of life route, the “Sau mein se sava sau” campaign illustrates a family where the girl highlights all positive attributes of her love interest to get her father’s approval. The film mirrors these qualities with the features of Activa 125 which is made for the smart and sensible people. The product- Activa 125 has all positive attributes she praises the boy for. Different features are compared to quality like – 1. Smart - LED Headlamp, LED Position Lamp and Chrome Chest, 2. Sensible- ECO mode indicator, 3. ‘Good Family’- Brand Activa and 4. Strong - Metal body. Parallel sequences weaved into the story substantiate the positioning of the scooter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story opens with a young daughter approaching the conversation seeking her father’s approval on her choice of husband. The father expresses initial scepticism about her choice. This is when the daughter elaborates on qualities of the boy which embodies the features of Activa 125. The first thing she mentions is his smartness where the film cuts to scooter’s chrome chest, LED headlamp &amp;amp; LED Tail Lamp. The girl then describes him as sensible with the film cutting close on Activa’s console with the ECO mode indicator. On the daughter’s request, the mother also supports her by saying that the boy belongs to a good family. It is when the film reveals that the scooter is an Activa- India’s most trusted two-wheeler. The daughter reiterates her choice by saying that ‘he is as strong as her father’ with the frame focusing on the metal body of Activa 125 personifying robustness and confidence. In the next frame, the boy is seen riding uphill smoothly with extra power and torque provided by Activa 125. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collaborating with the narration, the parallel stories merge together. The boy arrives on the Activa 125 and introduces himself as ’Captain Vikram’ and then he greets her mother. The father is extremely impressed with the boy when he relates to all his qualities with his choice of ride. He approves him by whispering to his daughter, “Sau me se sava sau hai!”. Summing up all features of the man, and consequently the Activa 125, the film ends with all four of them walking away together, with the voiceover “Wahi Activa Ka Trust Zyaada Power ke Saath!”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yadvinder Singh Guleria, Senior Vice President, Sales &amp;amp; Marketing, Honda Motorcycle &amp;amp; Scooter India Pvt. Ltd. said,“The purpose of this campaign is to showcase the new segment leading product features and reiterate trust of brand ’Activa’. With more than a million users, Activa 125 is synonymous to smartness, sensibility and strength. The power and torque of Activa 125 provides enhanced confidence to the customers especially on hilly roads.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Titus Upputuru, National Creative Director, Dentsu One said, “If you belong to a good family, you will have good genes. That’s the key insight we have taken to build communication for the campaign. Activa 125 hails from the family of Activa. The product scores 125 per cent in every aspect and that’s why the expression ‘sau mein se sava sau! Shooting the film in a cable car was very challenging but we are very excited to see the final outcome.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The Honda Activa 125 is an epitome of trust and technology combined with power. The campaign draws beautifully from the strength of the product and crafts a story that shows how human relationships can be beautifully formed on the bonds of trust and equanimity of power. It’s a great example of how product and consumer insights can be married to create a memorable brand story” said Abhinav Kaushik, Executive Vice President, Account Management, Dentsu One. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the video&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Raymond partners with YRF’s ‘Sui-Dhaaga- Made in India’ to promote skill development&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>Textile and fabric manufacturers&amp;nbsp;Raymond has&amp;nbsp;announced an association with Varun Dhawan and Anushka Sharma’s much-awaited film ‘Sui Dhaaga- Made In India’, which aims to promote skill development and entrepreneurship in rural and semi-urban India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Yash Raj Films’ entertainer celebrates the 'Make in India' campaign though the inspiring story of Mauji (Varun) and Mamta (Anushka) and their journey to create their own independent fashion label “Sui Dhaaga- Made in India.” Raymond is an integral part of the film’s reel life, as the film highlights its initiative to bring about a real-life socio-economic change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the association, Sanjay Behl, CEO, Lifestyle Business, Raymond Ltd. Said, “An initiative of Raymond to develop a sustainable tailoring ecosystem ensures economic prosperity and social dignity of the profession rings true to the theme of the film. With our commitment to Make in India, and in line with the Skill India Initiative, Raymond is already working towards up-skilling the existing tailoring ecosystem in the country by upgrading technology and providing employability on a sustainable basis. With a vision to train over one lakh tailors by the end of 2020 through our initiative, the seamless brand integration with ‘Sui Dhaaga- Made in India’ is an apt fitment for us”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With readymade labels appealing to the youth, tailoring as a profession is becoming secondary, and the craftsmanship is confined to the garmenting industry alone. In today’s fast-paced world, picking up a garment off-the-shelf does not guarantee the perfect fit and may not necessarily be a reflection of individual style. Hence, it cannot be contested that ‘the best fit is always a tailored fit’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manan Mehta, VP - Marketing and Syndication, YRF says, “Sui Dhaaga aims at not only bringing back the charm of tailoring and reinstating its relevance to the younger generation as portrayed by Mauji (Varun Dhawan) and Mamta (Anushka Sharma) in the movie, but also rekindle the spirit of entrepreneurship and craftsmanship, living true to the ‘Make In India’ revolution. And we couldn’t have asked for a better partner in this endeavour than Raymond, that truly lives up to the spirit of ‘Made In India’ and Swadesi. This association reinforces Raymond’s commitment to over 90 years of proudly Making in India.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Video:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>125 years of Swami Vivekananda's historic Chicago address</news:title>
      <news:description>Not many of the yoga worshipping generation in the US are probably aware of the fact that they owe the introduction of this life-transforming practice to their country to Swami Vivekananda, the first Hindu monk to cross the mighty oceans to reach the west and speak about the richness, expansiveness and the universal appeal of the Indian spiritual culture. &lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda was in all practical purposes the first ‘brand ambassador’ of India. The aura, mystique and charm associated with Brand India today owes its allegiance to this thoroughly modern nineteenth century saint, philosopher, poet, author, speaker, humanist, deep thinker and spiritual dynamo from Kolkata. He was the famous disciple of the nineteenth century ‘yuga avatar’ Sri Thakur Ramakrishna Paramahansa. Narendranath Dutta or Naren was Swami Vivekananda’s pre-monastic name.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While he was in Chennai before undertaking the trip to Chicago, it is said that he used to get regular visions from his master Sri Ramakrishna, urging him to attend the World Parliament of Religions. Then, one day, Thakur ‘appeared’ before him and told him that the World Parliament of Regions in Chicago was getting ready for him. The stage was being set for his grand arrival in the spiritual firmament of the world. There could not have been a clearer indication of the intense adulation that was to follow for Thakur Sri Ramakrishna’s favourite disciple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Swami Vivekananda started his speech at the august forum of The World Parliament of Religions in 1893 at Chicago by addressing his audience as “sisters and brothers of America”, he got a thunderous standing ovation that lasted more than two minutes. The spontaneous and heart-felt reaction from the audience was symbolic of the imprint his message would create in the hearts and minds of humanity across the world. A ratification of his master’s prediction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1538193750_BAwSat_Vivekananda_inside.jpg" style="width:443px;height:310px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His message of harmony, tolerance and universal acceptance stirred the depths of the human soul and re-established the relevance of practical spirituality in the lives of people, in a world torn by jealousy, greed, hatred &amp;amp; bloodshed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He laid the contours of a universal religion, underlining the man-making philosophy of Vedanta, where the only goal of every person should be the expansion of his personality and gradually manifesting the divinity lying dormant in him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When he spoke of sectarianism, bigotry and its horrible descendant fanaticism and how they have drenched the earth with human blood, destroyed civilization and sent whole nations to despair, he also spoke of tremendous hope and asserted the famous clarion call to humanity, saying “I fervently hope that the bell that tolled this morning in honour of this convention may be the death-knell of all fanaticism, of all persecutions with the sword or with the pen, and of all uncharitable feelings between persons wending their way to the same goal.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This significant message of harmony and brotherhood reverberated through minds, across the length and breadth of the globe. While it aroused tremendous interest in spirituality in the enterprising and active minds of the western citizen, it re-awakened spirituality and set the process of resurgence of the Indian mind. And that is an extremely poignant moment in the recent history of India. A nation that had gradually started losing the connection with the rich spiritual heritage of its past in the wake of more than a thousand years of invasion and subjugation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda’s ideas also influenced the leaders of pre-independent India, including Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Mahatma Gandhi, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, and is regarded as one of the creators of modern India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1921, Mahatama Gandhi on a visit to Belur Math on the occasion of Swami Vivekananda’s birth anniversary, said “I have gone through his works very thoroughly, and after having gone through them, the love that I had for my countrymen became a thousand-fold. I ask you young men not to go away empty handed without imbibing something of the spirit of the place Swami Vivekananda lived and died.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This comment truly exemplified the rich tapestry of patriotism, knowledge and love for the country that Swami Vivekananda brought alive in his messages. Western thinkers have spoken of him as the “moulder of the modern world”. A great humanist who loved humanity in the East as well as in the West.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through this lecture at the World Parliament of Religions at Chicago in 1893 and subsequent lecturing and teaching work for four and a half years in the USA and England, he raised the image of India to a high pedestal as the land of spirituality, harmony and rich cultural heritage. What is now known as modern Hinduism is largely Swami Vivekananda’s creation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, when humanity is at crossroads and values cherished over the centuries are getting eroded in the name of fanatic religious beliefs and dogmas, Swami Vivekananda’s message of universality, harmony, character building, strength and courage is even more relevant. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the historic address, Swami Satyadevananda, Head, Ramakrishna Math &amp;amp; Mission, Mumbai, said, “While we celebrate the 125th year of this momentous address delivered to transform the hearts and minds of humanity, this is also an opportunity to re-dedicate ourselves to imbibe, assimilate and realize the lofty and immensely relevant message of harmony and brotherhood of Swamiji. Let us individually and collectively strive to make the message of practical Vedanta, the message of caring and living for others a reality in every house, in every village, every district, in every relationship and association. Let Swamiji’s message be the glue that binds the new world order”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To commemorate this hallmark occasion, Ramakrishna Mission Mumbai will organise a day-long programme on September 29. At the event, senior monks from Ramakrishna Mission and different faiths of Christianity, Islam, Jainism, Zoroastrianism &amp;amp; Buddhism will present their interpretations on Swami Vivekananda’s speech and its relevance to society today. The cultural programme also includes an Indian classical dance exposition ‘Journey to divinity’ as a tribute to Swami Vivekananda. The function will be inaugurated by Governor of Maharashtra C H Vidyasagar Rao and graced by revered Swami Suviranandaji Maharaj, General Secretary, Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, Belur Math.</news:description>

      <news:title>US federal prosecutors ramp up investigation into unscrupulous media buying practices</news:title>
      <news:description>US federal prosecutors have begun issuing subpoenas in their ongoing investigation into unscrupulous  media buying practices in the advertising industry, which includes agencies receiving rebates from media outlets, according to reports. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As per&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;reports, some big&amp;nbsp;agencies have&amp;nbsp;disclosed that some of their subsidiaries were issued subpoenas by the Justice Department&amp;nbsp;in the ongoing investigation into whether agencies have manipulated the bidding process by urging independent companies to inflate their prices so that contracts could be awarded to&amp;nbsp;production and post-production departments owned by those agencies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The investigation follows years of scrutiny after a report by the Association of National Advertisers uncovered several non- transparent media practices, such as rebates, which were widespread in the industry. Although the report did not name specific agencies, many of them denied any wrong-doing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recently, media agencies have come under increasing pressure from clients pushing for more transparency and a curbing of ad fees, with many brands moving their creative work in-house.</news:description>

      <news:title>Synup launches Voice Readiness Test to assess voice search results </news:title>
      <news:description>Synup, the SaaS-based marketing technology company has launched The Voice Readiness Test - a free tool that lets businesses assess how their information appears on the most important voice search services including Amazon Alexa and Google Home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Voice search is now being used by customers in order to discover everything from ‘near me’ restaurants to local grocery stores. Synup’s Voice Readiness Test helps businesses stay ahead of the curve, and provides insights into how searchers consume their information across intelligent voice search systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to OC&amp;amp;C Strategy Consultants Study, in 2016, voice commerce sales touched $1.8 billion; and is expected to grow to $40 billion by 2022. The report also found that the majority of voice shopping users are younger, wealthier, with 72% of voice speaker owners saying that they use their devices as part of their daily routines.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashwin Ramesh, Founder and CEO of Synup said “Industry body ComScore estimates that 50% of all searches will be voice searches by 2020, and most businesses don't know if their information across voice search is accurate. It’s extremely frustrating to see that systems like Alexa can’t even answer basic questions like “is a place near me open right now”; we aim to build awareness among merchants and consumers to make voice more useful for the future.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Voice is the next evolution of search, and merchants need to be aware of what is being found about them across these ecosystems. The Voice Readiness Test helps these businesses benchmark their performance and provide a better customer experience on voice search over time.</news:description>

All of us at ITW Playworx Music then decided to give the song it's due respect like no other song in the past has ever received. The result is for all of you to see. Someone yesterday, very aptly defined this song as the Avengers of Singles. Asha Bhosle, Suresh Wadkar, Alka Yagnik, Abhijeet Bhattacharya, Shaan, Sonu Nigam, Vishal Mishra, Rashmi Virag and Sidhant Gupta, part of the same song, isn't it the most spectacular single ever?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

In the autotune era, we are still very lucky to be among the best.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shaan said, “The song is first of its kind in many ways. To have six voices interpreting the emotion of the same song in their unique style goes to prove that every individual looks at life differently.

      <news:title>Energy drink 1947 unveils inspiring stories of two kayakers</news:title>
      <news:description>Health energy drink, 1947 from Sipwise Beverages has tied up with kayakers Manish Rawat from Uttarakhand and Sweth Nisha from Bangalore, to host a video series on kayaking, showcasing the powerful feelings of freedom that the sport evokes in both kayakers. The video is an attempt to showcase what freedom means to two completely different individuals with different backgrounds, united by their love for kayaking as a means for expression. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tfO6sKWsyf8" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The video depicts how the two kayakers have committed to kayaking and are diligently pursuing their passion. Rawat is a potential future world champion in Kayaking hailing from the hills of Uttarakhand. The 18-year-old with diminutive looks, took to kayaking as a form of rebellion and to test the rapids in the Ganga Rivers. Over the years, he has managed to break free from his fear and find his calling in professional kayaking and aims to become a world champion. Nisha is from the urban flatlands of Bangalore, a product designer on weekdays and a free spirit on weekends. Through kayaking and negotiating the rapids, she aims to overcome her own as well as society's barriers about freedom &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the video, Harish Mohan, Founder of Sipwise said, ‘’How often do we get to chase freedom? How many of us are willing to unleash the wild adventurous side that keeps knocking the doors of our conscience? People tend to cheat adrenaline with lethargy. As a brand 1947 is committed to empowering our consumers to get rid of their inhibitions and fears. We hope in some small way this video inspires viewers to go out there and conquer their personal milestones. It is only fitting that as a brand we align ourselves with kayakers as we embody the importance of freedom.’’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1947 was formed with the idea to create a healthier energy drink. It uses the optimum amount of caffeine and uses a natural sweetener called inulin which is a great probiotic and improves gut health. Sipwise Beverages is one of the three companies in the world to offer inulin in a beverage format. Launched in 2017, Sipwise Beverages is a smart beverage company based in Vadodara that offers a range of unique functional beverage crafted with age-old natural ingredients such as  green tea coolers, herb coolers with natural caffeine from tea.</news:description>

      <news:title>Weekends for Sushil Matey are about reading, Bollywood movies and music</news:title>
      <news:description>For Sushil Matey- Director- Marketing, Livpure, weekends mean taking a small break from the hectic work life and enjoying some me-time&amp;nbsp;reading about human evolution&amp;nbsp;to fulfill his fascination with spirituality and anthropology.&amp;nbsp;He also loves being&amp;nbsp;with friends, singing in his free time and unwinding to the voice of Kishore Kumar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read on to find out more about what his weekends are like:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1538144277_Mudvx0_Mr._Sushil_Matey%2C_Director_-Marketing%2C_Livpure_Image__%282%29.jpg" style="width:300px;height:328px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a typical weekend, you will find me... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Enjoying and engaging in conversations with friends. A typical weekend is spent at Mumbai Cricket Association Club’s&amp;nbsp;Spin Bar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My idea of relaxing is...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a marketing person, my work schedule is always hectic and packed. I like spending time in the hills to relax and unwind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One vice I cannot do without... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is said that one should never share their vices in public. However, if I have to point out one, it shall be single malt, preferably Glenfiddich.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love a staycation/adventure... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe that hill stations are the best places for relaxation and staycation. You get to see new people, new cultures, try out new delicacies and cuisines. And&amp;nbsp;above all, you tend to make new memories of the places you have visited.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1538144276_7AOame_Mr._Sushil_Matey%2C_Director_-Marketing%2C_Livpure_Image__%283%29.jpg" style="width:400px;height:339px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I confess, I am a...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe in spirituality, good vibes and a sense of belonging. However, I must confess I am an atheist. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I spend me-time on...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like I said above, spirituality and anthropology fascinates me. I like to spend my me-time reading Stoics and human evolution. Eckhart Tolle is one of my favourite authors. Currently, I am reading Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last show I binge watched...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I generally prefer old Hollywood and Bollywood movies over shows. However, the last one which I binge-watched was Sacred Games on Netflix. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can make a mean ... to save my life...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I make a mean cup of coffee. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1538144275_9CTT4y_Mr._Sushil_Matey%2C_Director_-Marketing%2C_LivpureImage__%284%29.jpg" style="width:300px;height:270px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A skill/hobby I want to learn this year...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like singing in my free time and love to unwind and relax to the voice of Kishore Kumar. Being a music aficionado, I want to learn guitar this year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My next vacation/adventure will be….&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sicily.&amp;nbsp;Italy is the city where I envisage my next vacation to happen.</news:description>

      <news:title>Editor ji not a competitor to traditional media, it’s a force multiplier: Vikram Chandra </news:title>
      <news:description>In the wake of the rise of social media platforms, traditional forms of news consumption are undergoing a certain kind of metamorphosis to stay relevant. In this game of survival, some new ventures have come up to match the shifting taste of today’s consumer, and one among them is the recently launched news app Editor ji. The app is the brain child of country’s well-known journalist Vikram Chandra who stepped down as the CEO of NDTV Group in 2016.&lt;br&gt;The veteran journalist spoke to exchange4media about the inspiration behind his new venture and how it is attempting to bring back credibility in news. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your new venture Editor ji? What is it all about, what was the inspiration behind launching it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel a paradigm shift is required in the whole system and the ecosystem and there are five big reasons for it. Reason number one: if we look at TV News, subscription revenues are insignificant and there is carriage fee, so you are dependent on advertising in a big way. To depend on advertising, you are dependent on TRPs and to get TRPs you have to scream, you got to yell and you got to shout. Some people will say, okay, we don't want TRPs, and they have revenue problems. So that's the business model issue around television news. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second is a technological issue. You cannot control the content on TV news and you have to watch whatever the people are watching. And if people are increasingly watching debates, opinions and views, how do you get the news? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, let's come to digital video news. If you watch live news channel on an online platform or a video platform, it's the same as watching TV news. It is just that you're watching it on your mobile. You will still find people yelling and screaming and it is largely tabloid. So that doesn't help you very much. And when this digital format is not working, what's actually happening is that people are getting their video news from Facebook, Twitter and Whatsapp. But there are two major problems with that. The first problem is that a lot of it could be fake. You can't say that my Whatsapp feed is my source of news. How can Whatsapp feed or Facebook news be your credible news for the day? Another problem is that there are some good sources of content, but the issue is: how do they get the distribution? So if you've got a really good news story, how do you get it delivered to the right person?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The final problem is the form factor. Now, the form factors have to be designed around the India of today. Today 250 million Indians are consuming video online and by 2020 the numbers will grow to 500 million. This means 250 million fresh people are going to start accessing video on their mobile phones. How are they going to do it? What is the form factor for them? So that form factor doesn't exist right now and that is where Editor Ji comes in. It addresses all of these issues in a reasonably comprehensive way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From a mainstream media platform to this tech enabled start-up, how would you sum up this shift?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be honest, what I have done at a personal level all my life since I got into a career was to say: let's look for the next inflection point and let's try and build for that inflection point. In 1991, I left Oxford and decided to come back to India and work in broadcast journalism, which did not even exist in India then. There was no broadcast journalism, but I said we should try it and it will be the next wave and let's build for it. In 2000, I went to Prannoy (Roy) and said that the next wave is going to be the internet and I want to build a website. So I took over as the CEO of NDTV.com and we built it and we scaled it up right from 2000 onwards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2008-09, I was convinced that we have to find the next form factors which are mobile friendly. That's when we build the NDTV app. And that was the next wave. So if you think, there are waves happening right there. You have to find the next inflection point and get on to the next wave. Two years ago, when I was interviewing Sundar Pichai (CEO, Google), he said the next wave is coming and it is the AI (Artificial Intelligence) wave and it is going to systematically disrupt every business. And anybody who's not thinking of how AI is going to disrupt businesses, is going to be in a lot of trouble. So I put the two things together, TV and digital. I have run a digital business for 17 years and I've been in TV for 25 years. I thought let me teach myself enough about AI to figure out how do you combine AI theory, platform theory and TV news together with digital. How do you combine all four and create something that will solve the problems that the business is facing right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I’m extremely proud of what we have built and I am proud to put my name to it. I will debate and argue with anybody that this is as good as any newscast that you will see. The story rundown is being built by a combination of machine and human interference. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you saying that traditional news mediums are becoming irrelevant?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I genuinely believe that this is a supplementing factor. When TV came, everyone said that print will die. And when digital came, everyone said TV will die. And when mobile came, everyone said print and TV will die. So in the new generation of new form factors and AI-driven platforms, this will supplement what people are doing. This is a force multiplier and I would actually urge all traditional media players to view us as a force multiplier because that's what we are. Not only TV, for print publications, we are even more relevant because when they want to get into video, they don't have a television news channel of their own. With us, they can create a TV news channel in just 30 seconds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your revenue model, is it a paid app?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is absolutely free, for the simple reason that what we want to do is also solve a certain problem-- getting credible reliable information into the hands of 1.3 billion Indians. As 250 million Indians are going to come online to watch video, the question is: how are they going to watch it? How are they going to get the news? We want to give them that ability to do it. You just come, you press a button and you are getting news. As of now, we have the funding till we break even. So we may not need more funding. We are looking at two years or so to break even.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So when AI sits on the edit table, does it allow traffic to influence journalism?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Traffic does impact journalism but there are ways to get around it. We've figured out ways of how to do it right. There are certain things, especially top stories, where the human influence is very high. We are clear that at least in the initial stages, the newscast gets only assisted by AI and we have not given the keys to AI.</news:description>

      <news:title>WATCH: Technology plays an important role in content marketing: Kanika Mohan Saxena, Vodafone Idea</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;em&gt;A Bloomberg Quint Initiative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanika Mohan Saxena, Vice President Digital Content Services Vodafone Idea Limited, in conversation with exchange4media, speaks about content marketing campaigns and the role of technology in content marketing. She believes that most of the content marketing is led by the objective of that campaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What according to you are the key aspects of a good content marketing campaign?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key aspects are two fold, one is stickiness to the content (from the consumer’s perspective), and secondly, the success; the traditional ways of looking at it, whether it is likeable or shareable, whether people are talking about it, or if it is led by PR. Those are the valuations we ascertain saying that a content is great or not. There must be a way, a process or a method where you are able to go beyond these because I am still seeing they are very niche at the moment. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the performance indicators for a content marketing campaign?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think most of the content marketing is led by the objective of that campaign. If the campaign objective is brand, then of course there is the resonance of the brand, the proposition of the brand is one part and the second part is entertaining and educating the consumer through content. We are also leaving some method for them to resonate to what you said. Depending on the brand, there are two different objectives. Most of the brands today are still stuck at the first piece. I am hoping that this will move to the latter part where the brands are able to tell a story and more brands will be telling a story, with the just the brand message in the back. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have you seen branded content and content marketing evolve?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been in the business of Television, Films, launching OTT platforms, branded content agencies. For content creators it is a great time, today with almost everybody producing content those avenues have opened because the consumer has become smart. There are so many opportunities out there. They are saying by 2022 the mobile handset users will grow multiple folds. I think it is a great time for everybody, because today, entertainment doesn't mean just watching a television or a film, it is watching anything and everything on the go. I foresee this going on for the next 3 years, that is when the point will come where we will be able to ascertain those who are there to stay and those who will fall out. Content making is a very expensive proposition, the producers should be able to monetise it at a point of time. Is the consumer willing to pay at this point of time? the answer is yes and no. I personally feel if the consumers like it, they buy it and we have seen examples with the success of Netflix, Amazon Prime, Balaji, ALT Balaji, Hot Star. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am glad I am part of this time and hope we all will be to entertain the consumers on whichever screen they choose. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the role of technology in content marketing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technology plays an important role. Today digitally you are almost listening to anything and everything, you know exactly what the consumer wants, what they are looking for. For example, key words, you know what the consumer is searching for and not getting. That’s an insight and it is also an opportunity for you to able create more source as per your business objective. I think, Netflix has done this well, they are spending billions of dollars doing this. With Artificial Intelligence, Netflix presents content to you depending on the thumbnails you have seen previously because the results tells them only 2 seconds is the time you take time to understand whether you want to watch a piece of content or not. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, we are investing a lot of money in AI to be able to understand the consumer. If you come on Vodafone Play and watch content with us, the app will talk to you and that will be a one-on-one experience. I think that’s a great space to able to know and cater accordingly, that is when you form a relationship with the consumer and then they will stay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BWA_i89odm8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Samsonite’s latest campaign tries to revive tourism in Kerala after floods </news:title>
      <news:description>Known for its golden palm-lined beaches, emerald backwaters, tea plantations and powerful art forms, the state of Kerala provides diverse opportunities to rejuvenate travellers. However, Kerala has suffered a major setback in its tourism numbers due to the recent devastating monsoon floods. Since a substantial segment of Kerala’s employment is generated from tourism, this sudden decline has massively affected people whose livelihood depend on the sector. &lt;br&gt;Considering it as its social responsibility, Samsonite has taken up the initiative to launch a campaign focusing on reviving tourism in Kerala. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samsonite has incepted a campaign that tugs on the heartstrings of tourists around the globe to visit Kerala. Through this initiative, Samsonite endeavours to motivate more tourists to experience this beautiful state, the company said in a statement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After overcoming the adverse impacts of the calamity with courage and unity, Kerala is now open to welcome its much-awaited guests. As a part of the #KeralaIsOpen campaign, the travel brand portrays the essence of Kerala through an impactful short film. This beautifully rendered video captures the essence of every individual involved in the tourist sector from taxi drivers, lodge managers, elephant mahouts and others eagerly waiting to welcome their guests.&amp;nbsp;The campaign’s mission is to remind travellers of the beauty of Kerala and to inspire them to come together and revive tourism in Kerala. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the initiative, Anushree Tainwala- Executive Director-Marketing, Samsonite South Asia, said, “Through this campaign, we hope more and more people travel to Kerala. We want people to recognise that the only thing more unique than Neelakurinji is the heart of the people in Kerala. So let’s now embrace the spirits of the people and travel to Kerala because #KeralaIsOpen.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;P Bala Kiran, Director, Kerala Tourism, Government of Kerala, shared, “Thanks to the support of all our brothers and sisters from all over India, Kerala has made it through the last few difficult months. Now that we are rebuilding, we need to revive our tourism industry as a quarter of our employment comes from it. I welcome the people of India and tourists all over the world to visit the beautiful city of Kerala and show their support and love for the people of Kerala. It’s absolutely safe to travel to Kerala now and the loving people of Kerala are waiting for its beautiful tourists.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Credits:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Agency: Autumn Worldwide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Vice President &amp;amp; Branch Head: Bodh Deb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Creative Director: Nishanth Ananthram&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Brand Manager: Eram Khan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Production House: Momomoto Studios&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Director: Deepti Nagia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gpTMhLWUZCQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>By 2022, mobile sales opportunity for financial services brands in India worth USD 985 bn </news:title>
      <news:description>Facebook has released the fifth and final research report for the Indian financial services industry under its programme called Zero Friction Future by Facebook IQ. Launched earlier this year, the programme aims to define, understand and mitigate friction in consumer purchase journeys to unlock business growth with use of mobile in media mix. The reports are authored by KPMG in India, based on primary research and insights based on the survey conducted by Nielsen for various industry verticals. Titled “Eliminating friction in financial services path to purchase”, the report highlights, the significant role mobile can play to increase the consumer purchase, when buying a credit card, insurance and loans in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the launch of the report, Pulkit Trivedi, Director, Facebook India, said “India could not be more ready for a digital revolution in financial services – with government interventions on one hand and growing consumer awareness on the other. As more and more Indians access the internet on their mobile phones, there is a big opportunity for financial companies to create a powerful digital experience that is intuitive, more seamless and free of friction points for their customers. The reports aims at assisting credit card, loans and insurance brands in designing mobile and digital driven marketing strategies which could help them in winning a greater share of financial buyers, at an improved RoI on marketing spend.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The report suggests that in the credit cards category, 29 per cent of consumers drop out due to friction, and nearly one-third of this friction is caused by media. As for the insurance category, 37 per cent of consumers drop out due to friction, and nearly half of this friction is caused by media, while in the loans category, 32 per cent of consumers drop out due to friction, and nearly one-fourth of this friction is caused by media. The study further highlights that by 2022, mobile platforms are expected to influence 8 out of 10 credit card and insurance purchases, about 6 out of 10 personal loan purchases and around 7 out of 10 other loan purchases, creating USD 658 billion sales opportunity for financial services brands in India.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Gayathri Parthasarathy, Head, Financial Services - Advisory, KPMG in India, said, “With increased penetration of smartphones and internet, the number of mobile first customers for the financial sector is rapidly increasing. Also, with app economy gaining prominence, digital is surely bringing a paradigm shift in the way financial sector engages and services its customers today. Digital savvy customers expect a nearly seamless, device agnostic experience in their financial transactions for something as simple as seeking credit card statements/renewing insurance to something as complex as applying for and securing loans. Any inconvenience or an additional step in this path to purchase of a financial product can lead to loss of customers in this extremely competitive environment which we define as friction. The report aims to understand this very aspect for the broader financial sector inclusive of loans, credit cards and insurance sector and how mobile could help marketers reduce this friction.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;As per the report findings, mobile-enabled purchase journeys are shorter than offline purchases by 22 per cent for credit cards, 17 per cent for insurance and 8 per cent for loan categories. Mobile has the potential to reduce friction by 3 percentage points across the purchase journey for credit cards and personal and other loans, while reducing friction to 5 percentage points across the purchase journey for life insurance. The study also revealed that mobile could help brands tap into a credit card transaction opportunity of USD38 billion, insurance premium income opportunity of USD70 billion and loans outstanding opportunity of USD219 billion, by reducing media friction. Additionally, mobile is also expected to increase efficiency in consumer acquisition cost when compared to traditional mediums by up to 21 percent for credit cards and personal loans, 24 per cent for other loans, 31 per cent for life insurance and 29 per cent for other insurance, creating an overall USD 985 billion sales opportunity for brands, by influencing purchases and reducing media friction in the consumers' purchase journey.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Of all the categories that we have explored so far with Facebook, the Financial Services category is where digital media touch-points are already well embedded, and continue to become increasingly prominent, in the path to purchase of the customers right from generation of awareness to exciting the customer about the product/service and lastly while making the application of a loan/insurance/credit card,” said Ashish Karnad, Executive Director - Marketing Effectiveness, Nielsen India. “Given the nature of the category, and from what we see in the report as well, prompt and clear information is a key driver for purchases in this category. We hope this study will give advertisers and customers an insightful understanding of the category landscape and how customers are interacting with touchpoints during their purchase journey while also providing a bird's eye view on the possible opportunities missed by marketers due to media friction and bring in further optimization,” he added.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;According to the research, top friction areas for different demographic cohorts vary and hence marketers need to customize their marketing strategy accordingly. Some key consumer friction areas across touch points include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;•  Gender based: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;o  Credit cards category - Despite high marketing focus by credit card brands towards men, a substantial number of women consumers enter the credit card purchase journey, which makes them a lucrative consumer segment for brands. &lt;br&gt;o  Insurance category - While a larger number of men enter the life insurance purchase funnel, women have a better purchase conversion rate than men. Both men and women actively look out for offers when considering any other insurance purchase, however, women’s purchase journeys are triggered by life events. &lt;br&gt;o  Personal and other loans category - While a higher number of men than women enter the purchase funnel for personal loans, their dropout rate at the awareness stage is 2.5 times compared to women. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;•  Age specific:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;o  Credit cards category - 25–34 year-old consumers face the highest friction (34 per cent) throughout the credit card purchase journey. Such consumers are new entrants in the workforce and seek detailed communication to understand the product. Slow turn-around time by brands to reach out to them can lead to dropouts. Comparatively, the 35–49 year-olds are an aware and evolved audience, who are existing credit card users. However, this segment faces trust issues at the intent stage as they are used to relationship-based banking. Hence, brands need to replicate an offline experience on the digital medium to facilitate their online purchase journey.&lt;br&gt;o  Insurance category - Consumers in the age group of 25–34 years are more likely to purchase life insurance or other insurance, if provided with detailed product communication with a quick call to action. 35–49 years-old consumers are more category aware and actively look out for better policy offers and seek advice to make a purchase. However, they face high friction at the top of the funnel due to premium affordability and lack of assistance in understanding the product.&lt;br&gt;o  Personal and other loans category - Young professionals and earners are more likely to purchase a personal loan. Consumers in the age group of 25–34 years look out for relevant information and timely response from brands for personal loans. Limited information from ads and long lead time of response on queries result in high friction for consumers aged over 35 years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;•  Socio-economic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;o  Credit cards category - NCCS A consumers seek prompt response from banks while NCCS B consumers seek query resolution and reassurance for their purchase decision. NCCS A consumers face friction at the intent stage as brands fail to swiftly address consumer queries leading to drop outs. NCCS B consumers depend on representative interaction to get reassurance on their financial decisions. Delayed responses and the inability of representatives to address queries are the key friction points at the intent stage for NCCS B consumers. &lt;br&gt;o  Insurance category - NCCS A consumers purchase conversion is almost twice that of NCCS B consumers for life insurance. However, more than 60 per cent of the friction for both categories occurs at the top of the funnel. NCCS A consumers seek offer communication while NCCS B consumers seek relevant information. Other insurance such as travel insurance and motor insurance is often coupled with travel ticket and new vehicle purchases, and consumers are largely loyal to policy purchased at the point of sale. Hence, other insurance ads may go unnoticed unless brands try to catch consumers’ attention through competitive pricing, better policy services and seamless policy switching. Both NCCS A and NCCS B consumers actively look out for offers for other insurance policies. &lt;br&gt;o  Personal and other loans category - 1 out of 4 NCCA A consumers who enter the purchase journey ends up applying for a personal loan, while the figure is only 1 out of 6 for NCCS B consumers. The higher conversion rate for NCCS A consumers may be because they are more likely to make lifestyle expenses such as costly international trips, while NCCS B consumers opt for personal loans based on utilitarian needs. NCCS A consumers are twice more likely to purchase other loans as compared to NCCS B consumers. NCCS A consumers are digitally active, and face top of the funnel friction on traditional mediums like print and radio. However, they face friction when they do not receive relevant responses or due to lack of trust on the medium while NCCS B consumers drop out when they are unable to connect with the branch/representative or due to a lack of response from the brands despite expressing interest in purchases.</news:description>

      <news:title>Google Search Turns 20: New trends in search marketing</news:title>
      <news:description>Earlier this week, Google marked the 20th anniversary of the now omnipresent and in many ways even omniscient Search. Search has exploded over the last two decades. It quickly grew from helping people explore the internet to becoming a powerful tool to identify intent and serve ads to potential consumers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evergreen format &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Search advertising market in India is currently worth Rs 2,128 crore and is the second biggest digital ad format that advertisers spend on after social media. According to Dentsu Aegis Network e4m Digital Report, the Search market is expected to be worth Rs 2,660 by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 25 per cent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though Search may be growing at a slower rate than some other ad formats on digital like display and video, “Search remains a relevant tool for advertisers as most consumer journeys begin with Search,” explains Sanjay Mehta, Jt-CEO, Mirum India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Companies in the e-commerce, BFSI, and retail categories are the three largest spenders on this format setting aside nearly 42, 37, and 23 per cent of their total digital spends on Search respectively. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Being a pull driven tool, Search is my personal favourite digital advertising tool,” says Shrenik Gandhi, co-founder and CEO of White Rivers Media, as he explains why Paid Search is an evergreen tool for advertisers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEO before you leap&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brands are currently highly focussed on strengthening SEO and SEM hygiene practices. “The perfect combination of SEO, SEM, and the integration of new tools like click-to-call makes Search Engines a great destination to be discovered for brands,” says Vishal Chinchankar - Chief Digital Officer - Madison World. “Brands need a mix of all these elements to have an omnipresence across Search on various platforms,” he adds. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While large evolved brands are already focussed on SEO, some smaller brands have not recognised the importance of SEO yet. Venugopal Ganganna, CEO, Langoor, advices small and medium-sized businesses to recognise the importance of SEO and invest in building websites and webpages that are optimised for search. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Search destinations &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google pioneered a whole new format of paid advertising on the internet. Now, 20 years later, as consumer behaviour evolves, Paid Search has transcended Google and entered the newer realms. Brands are shifting Paid Search spends to e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Facebook which are also destinations for Search. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mehta says that consumers are now Searching on a multitude of platforms, from Facebook and Instagram to Pinterest and even within Whatsapp groups. Anil K Nair, Managing Partner, Law &amp;amp; Kenneth Saatchi &amp;amp; Saatchi, says that the monopoly that Google had on Search is decreasing slowly. “Many players are approaching the Search market from their own perspectives,” he says. According to him, video search and search aggregators are also attracting Paid Search monies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nair adds that “search on the go through mobile is increasing and emerging as a whole new sub-category with its own dynamics.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voice search &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is another significant shift in consumer behaviour: voice search. According to a research by comScore, 50 per cent of all searches will be voice searches by 2020. The technology to recognise human voice is constantly improving and according to Amazon’s 2017 Annual Report, Alexa’s spoken language understanding improved by more than 25% in 2017. And the company has “dramatically reduced the amount of time required to teach Alexa new languages by using machine translation and transfer learning techniques, which allows them to serve customers in more countries (like India).” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nair and Mehta say that as consumers use more of voice Search, brands will have to start making themselves available to the section of consumers who are using voice. In the case of voice search, a brand will have to ensure that the its suggesting appears within the top 3-5 organic results or risk losing out to competitors, says Mehta. He says that not appearing within the top results on Voice is more harmful to a brand than appearing on the fourth page of the search results. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some Indian brands such as Magicbricks, Zomato, and Nearbuy are known to be investing in voice search capabilities and the number of brands that tap into voice to increase consumer engagement in expected to rapidly grow over the next year. And then may be instead of Googling, users will simply be speaking to their voice assistants to help them out. It sounds like a science-fiction, but it’s not as much in the future as it seems.</news:description>

      <news:title>Our mission is to empower the next billion online users in India: Umang Bedi, Dailyhunt</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;With 88 per cent of our population being non-English speaking, 70 per cent of users access Internet in regional languages. Some advertisers and marketers&amp;nbsp;exchange4media spoke to are of the opinion that with the combined effect of growing vernacular content online and a mobile-first to mobile-only approach, will not only boost the growth of Indian Internet by leaps and bounds, but also improve digital literacy in rural India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Experts cited genres&amp;nbsp;such as&amp;nbsp;entertainment; video streaming, messaging, surfing social networking sites and news, as among the most used applications by regional content users online. Seeking linguistic equality in India, content aggregator multimedia-app, Dailyhunt focuses on empowering the next billion online Indians to discover, socialise and consume local content that is not just informational but also enriching and entertaining.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Discussing the changing Internet consumption pattern which clearly indicates how regional language online users are driving the next phase of Internet adoption in India, we spoke to Umang Bedi, President, Dailyhunt. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Citing some statistics, Bedi&amp;nbsp;said that with the growing popularity in multilingual video users, by the year 2021 India’s Internet ecosystem would attain 735 million consumers and the increase will be largely seen in local languages with the user base growing to 535 million users, leaving the English language base largely stagnant with only 200 million users. Leveraging this, Dailyhunt claims to have experienced high growth in terms of absolute numbers of new users being added every month, and has managed to double their monthly active user base within a span of 6 months&amp;nbsp;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the app’s contribution to the regional user base versus its competitors, Umang said, “With Internet pivoting, we have redefined our mission to serve India, providing a more fulfilling visual experience to our users as a multimedia app. We have put in several plans around user growth, engagement growth and revenue as well.”  With the focus being on video ad formats today, creating content which is relevant and engaging enough is of utmost priority for any brand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When asked about the quality of content the app engages in, to make an impact in the market where there is actually no dearth of creative ad formats today, Bedi&amp;nbsp;said that the app engaged with content from verified authoritative sources, be it in the form of video, text or images across 14 different languages. The content included political, national and government related news, along with local content updating users about their own cities. However, about 50 per cent of their consumption was in the non-news category involving cricket, lifestyle, Bollywood, women-leadership and youth content.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;For any platform to challenge the existing digital giants in India’s digital advertising market, it is crucial to be able to drive first-time Internet users to level-up engagement, grow on video and hyper-local content which enables the retention of users. With respect to the advertising domain, an effective ad format will always leave behind a lasting impression in the minds of its users. Having said that, with competition getting stiffer, brands today are building on creative ad campaigns, serving in digital, mobile, and even traditional formats. Realising, the potential of a strong ad campaign in the market, Dailyhunt has come up with a 60-man direct sales team, which works with the top brands in India around advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the app has also launched a self-serve 'Server Message Block' (SMB) interface focusing on small-medium businesses to advertise via Dailyhunt availing Geo-targeting capabilities to that of a pin-code level. The brand has invested in partnerships with agencies Denstu Aegis, WPP and&amp;nbsp;Publicis Groupe, performing data integration between its inventory and their proprietary media planning tools.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Watch: Content marketing is not a cheaper alternative to advertising: CCO, Wavemaker</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;em&gt;A Bloomberg Quint Initiative &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Karthik Nagarajan, Chief Content Officer, Wavemaker, in a conversation with exchange4media, shares his thoughts on content marketing campaigns, and how brand can capitalise on native advertising. According to him, content marketing is not a cheaper alternative to advertising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What according to you are the key aspects of a good content marketing strategy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fundamentally we should start with a very clearly defined purpose. Most of the stuff that ends up making it to the world are things that are good to do, are cool to do, but they are often solutions looking for a problem. It really always helps to have a very clearly defined sense of purpose. In fact, everything else is secondary in my opinion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content marketing can help reduce your overall marketing costs. Do you agree?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I strongly disagree with this, I don’t think content marketing is a cheaper alternative to advertising. The way we look at content in Wavemaker is communication beyond advertising. It could be a tweet, post on Facebook, video, or activation, rural campaign; all of them are pretty much different stops in the content journey for a brand. So, to say that it is essentially cheaper then main line advertising or any other form of advertising is to completely misunderstand, and even disrespects the possibilities of content marketing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transition of branded content or content marketing from what it was five years ago to what it is now? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think the big change is that content creation as a function has been democratised; five years back we were still talking about the large creative houses, brands, broadcasters and publishers as the ‘Custodians of Content'. Today, the democratisation of the creative ecosystem is the biggest difference. Second, is what we can do in terms of measurement, social listening in terms of applying neuro- science to content effectiveness, applying brand lift to content effectiveness all of that is significantly changed. These two are biggest changes in my opinion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native advertising and how brands capitalise on it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Native is one of those things that have been there for a fairly long time. Whether it’s advertorial or brand integrated into a long form content as a sponsored article. They are not new things, but I feel somehow it has never reached the tipping point. Today, when there is a campaign launch, brands use native fairly intuitively, you will always see an accompanying article, but to me the power of native is actually between the campaigns. It gives brands a very unique ability to continue to keep telling their stories between campaigns and it should be a continuous piece. A brand can easily create about 60-70 different stories about itself in a given area in my opinion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5r0mOzbXOww" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>We believe that big work will always trump big brands: Kawal Shoor, The Womb</news:title>
      <news:description>To say that there has been no dearth of independent agencies that have cropped up in India in the last couple of years won’t be far-fetched. However, the point of departure from the norm is when a Planner and an Account Management person come together to start an agency, more importantly without a head of creative and with an talent pool which includes anthropologists and clinical psychologists. Safe to say that premium advertising and innovations agency, The Womb started by (ex-Ogilvy &amp;amp;Mather) Navin Talreja and Kawal Shoor is not your mainstream creative agency. One of the Founders, Shoor chatted with exchange4media on their work for Carvaan that has become all the rage, making it big in the advertising industry space without pitching and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ditch the pitch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike many other agencies, The Womb doesn’t choose to go through the pitching route. Shoor emphatically states that a four week pitch exercise is unlikely to solve a problem a client has been grappling with for months or years. “We abhor the psychology of a pitch. It immediately puts one party above the other. ‘We will decide, and come back to you…’ is not something we wanted to build relationships on. Often, even the pitch brief is not real. So as a senior heavy team, we feel it a serious waste of time that is better spent on clients who pay us,” he asserts. He is quick to add that he would have absolutely loved to work with Spotify &amp;amp; Netflix. “Two of the hottest new-age brands, but we chose to very regretfully decline those pitches. Someday…” says Shoor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The turning point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shoor attributes the actual turning point for the agency as working on the memorable ‘Fogg chal raha hai’ ad which was just within a few months of starting out. “Perhaps that was a turning point in the eyes of potential clients – who saw that we could do famous work, without a regular agency creative structure (NCD, etc.) And that brought us lots of pitch offers (which we politely declined), but also a few clients who understood our way and aligned with us. And then of course, Carvaan happened,” he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work, wins and walking tall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shoor calls the agency’s current mix of clients as a motley crew of believers. “From MNCs, to home-grown, from heritage to new age, we have them all. But there’s one thing they have in common – they fully resonate with our thinking that big work will always trump big brands. Some say that there should be big work on big brands, but what’s ideal is big work that makes brands big. Across all our clients, our points of contact are the decision-makers, and we like it to be that way,” he says. The Founder believes that no one should have the right to share a job brief if he or she doesn’t have the power to approve or reject the work coming off it. “It just cuts short unnecessary and painful hours of intellectual and creative slogging,” he lets out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The agency’s work for Carvaan won them reams of awards and shortlists. When asked what went behind the making of it all, he recounts, “To begin with, the brief from the client was that they have over 1.20,000 songs from the Golden Era of Indian music and wanted us to develop a plan to monetise this asset base by getting the young Indian (16 - 35 year olds) to start listening to this music.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While typically agencies would have responded with an ad campaign on a brief such as this or thought of small activation ideas that would get people interested in the music, what The Womb chose to do instead was to re-frame the problem. “Why would the young listen to this music? Are we barking up the wrong tree? Doesn't it make logical sense to sell these songs to the audience that grew up with this music? With the death of CD's and Cassettes and their own discomfort with the digital medium, this audience had no access to this music. So instead of designing a campaign or a small unscalable activation, we chose to offer them that music in a form that they were accustomed to- The Radio,” explains Shoor. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“And it all made sense when they see the top-line growth and the growth in the share price of the company post the launch of this product,” he continues. When quizzed about if the awards mattered, Shoor admits that only the effectiveness awards mattered. “Because they mattered to clients. They provided validation that good (bold) work works. And they set off a virtuous cycle,” he opens up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A candid Shoor says, “But even in those, there is now a new villain emerging. The scam case in an effectiveness show! Such cases for instance are typically built on some activation or engagement idea which may have been supported by just 10% of the overall budget, and may have been exposed to only 5% of the overall target audience. And 70% of the budget would have likely gone to the good old solid but utterly non-sensational product demo ad on TV, which may have really done the job. Of course, this is craftily hidden by the case-writer. I was doing jury duties for the WARC Asian Prize for Strategy a few weeks ago, and true to expectation I encountered some of these. And agencies have won big on those very cases. You can just throw your hands up in exasperation, and wish that truth can prevail.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the way forward for the agency, he says that the only thing he is sure of is that they will try new things and continue innovating. “We continue to believe that good work, and happy clients will be our biggest advertisements,” says Shoor with an air of finality.</news:description>

      <news:title>Britannia launches ad campaign to mark its 100 years </news:title>
      <news:description>Britannia is marking its centenary year with a multi-media campaign aimed to connect with the very heterogeneous set of audiences that its brands cater to. The campaign consists of a 10-film TVC series, a long-format film for digital and social media, print, radio and OOH. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TV campaign&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a statement released by the company, the campaign is Britannia’s thank you to a heterogeneous country like India with a concept based on the thought that when you think of someone/something and it arrives, the instant reaction you have is ‘Tu sau saal jiyega' (You are going to live to 100 years!), an idiom which is a part of every Indian language. The stories in the TV campaign are about how Britannia has turned 100 only because they’ve always been there for their consumers, just when they were needed most.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each clip takes a simple situation and highlights the bond between customer and product. The campaign also builds the symphony of Britannia through its product brands and the various roles that the brand plays in its consumers’ lives. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537962108_k34qUu_britannia_tv.jpg" style="width:443px;height:263px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the TV campaign, Ali Harris Shere, VP Marketing, said “Being part of every Indian household is an honor and this multimedia campaign illustrates our gratitude to the millions of Indians who wake up every day to dip a Britannia biscuit into their chai, and reach out for our products through various parts of the day. The 100-year campaign is our way of acknowledging the secret ingredient of our success – our consumers.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chairman and Chief Creative Officer at Lowe Lintas Arun Iyer, said “The brief was to thank the entire country with a simple idea that would seem relatable no matter where you are from. All 10 films are slices of life that have been picked from Britannia’s world. The challenge was to tell a brand’s story of completing 100 years and finding powerful emotions to connect with the consumers. But given how long Britannia has been a part of our lives, we found so many heartfelt moments to tell the story of a brand that has turned 100 because it’s always been there for its consumers. And the huge range of products that Britannia has gave us the room to tell stories across all age groups to make sure that campaign would resonate strongly with everyone.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long format film for the 100% digital natives&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The digital film is knitted with old-world charm, adding flavours of the past, present and future while capturing a mélange of occasions across the century where a Britannia product has been integral to friendships, celebrations and togetherness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From sharing biscuits in the classroom and cheering for a World Cup win to connecting in the selfie era and looking 10 years into the future, the film pays a warm tribute to the journey thus far and looks ahead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537962183_8tmyQd_britannia_digital.jpg" style="width:443px;height:253px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the digital film, Shere said, “We wanted to create a film that would evoke strong emotion around the bonds of friendship and how these relationships evolve just as India is evolving. You see this through the parent, child relationships where we showcase how the current generation has a relationship that is a bit more playful and friend-like than previous generations. The film seeks to illustrate how Britannia has, is and will be part of all friendships, whether starting at school or looking into the future where we are sharing snacks with our robot pals.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“Friendship seemed like a theme worthy of a hundred years and Britannia’s role in fueling those precious moments was a great story to tell. We travelled through time in the film, with the set design and camera movement designed to feel like the viewer was journeying through 100 years, revisiting one iconic friendship moment from each decade, until friendship comes back full circle with an interesting futuristic twist. From the parapet wall that fostered close friendships to the social wall that multiplied them, to walls breaking down at home, along with barriers, to make friends of family, this film is an endearing and insightful commentary on friendship even as it’s a journey through its timeline.” said Priya Shivakumar, Creative Head, JWT Bangalore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other elements of Britannia’s #100 year celebration campaign&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Britannia’s centenary year campaign also consists of high visibility OOH, print and radio set to roll out soon across the country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Britannia’s new brand identity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elaborating on the new logo identity of Britannia, Shere said “We have a 100 year heritage and wanted to be sure that we continued to reach every Indian household - to bring in a newness yet remain uniquely Britannia. We undertook extensive research to help us unlock how consumers viewed Britannia and found that consumers place our brand right in the middle of excitement and goodness. This helped inform our new brand proposition, designed within a framework that balances our heritage and provides a contemporary appeal to the brand."&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;"Designed under the premise that our products carry both excitement and goodness, we held on to our heritage red, made green a bit more vibrant and added in a new color yellow. The new logo identity also has great shelf throw, which is critical in our cluttered retail environment. As we look to emerge as a 'Global total foods company’, this new logo is crafted to unbox Britannia and open it up to bright new horizons,” Shere added.</news:description>

      <news:title>Shah Rukh Khan plays four different roles as father in new BYJU campaign</news:title>
      <news:description>BYJU’S has unveiled its new ad campaign featuring Shah Rukh Khan, comprising four different ad films wherein the superstar plays a Gujarati, Sikh, Tamil, and a Bengali father. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Launched along with the latest and more personalised version of the BYJU’S-App, this campaign celebrates the unique learning requirements of every student and how they are seamlessly adapting to learning via technology today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Addressing the urgent need of personalized learning experiences for every student, the four TVCs explore the #ThingsDadsSay about their children’s learning habits. Each 'Dad Avatar’ brings to light the changing learning preferences among students, and how they are adapting to learning platforms that offer them personalized and engaging content.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Conceptualized and created by Lowe Lintas, this series of TVCs have been centered on the core idea of evolving learning habits of students and how learning with technology is fun and engaging. Each of the four TVCs captures some witty and relatable exchanges between a father and a child on how learning should actually be. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the new ad-campaign, Mrinal Mohit, Chief Operating Officer, BYJU’S – The Learning App, said, “This new TV campaign addresses the apprehensions of the modern day parent while showing how students are going beyond the conventional ways and adapting to new-age learning methods to strengthen their concepts. Additionally, Shah Rukh Khan playing four different regional avatars will help us to reach out and create a deeper connect with parents and students across geographies too. In fact, we are confident that our message will bolster the confidence in every parent that learning via technology will make their child a better learner.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Talking about being a part of this new ad series, Shah Rukh Khan said , “Technology has become an integral part of our lives and using digital mediums/devices comes very naturally to children today. I am thrilled to be part of this new ad campaign of BYJU’S that aims at helping students and parents understand the importance of personalized learning. It was a great experience to play the role of four different dads from across the country. In fact, I believe that the innovation and creativity brought in by BYJU’S in the digital learning space has really helped students approach learning in a completely different way. It is a good way to encourage children to initiate learning on their own.”&lt;br&gt;Watch the new TVCs here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cwi1-n8EnWo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;• &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y4tvRIV0xK4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;• &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HkomwMKFdQQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;• &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DaDP6u7OWEI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Criteo partners with Tata Cliq to boost in-app customer engagement</news:title>
      <news:description>Through its data-driven technology, Criteo (NASDAQ: CRTO), the advertising platform for the open Internet, partnered with Tata CLiQ, Tata Group’s multi-brand, Phygital ecommerce platform in India, to better understand their shoppers’ online browsing behaviour. The App Advertising through Criteo Dynamic Retargeting has helped TataCLiQ in delivering visually appealing ads and increasing their customer engagement. &lt;br&gt;Siddharth Dabhade, General Manager, Criteo, said, “Digital consumers in India today have a variety of choices when it comes to e-commerce platforms, millions of products and services to choose from, and multiple devices to engage and discover on. Thus, it is complicated and expensive for retailers to find, attract and retain customers and ultimately generate longterm loyalty for their platforms. So, it has become even more important that retailers take advantage of retargeting in digital advertising, to discover and retain their real customers.”&lt;br&gt;As a trend there has been a rapid rise in customers using multiple devices and multiple platforms while browsing for shopping. Therefore, targeting the consumer at the right time, providing convenience and personalised engagement has been the key to achieve the desired results. With Criteo’s in-app retargeting solution, Tata CLiQ has been delivering personalised ads that are scalable to all ad sizes across a wide variety of mobile apps. Tata CLiQ has delivered the right ad at the right moment in the shopper’s journey, so that customers are encouraged to purchase, rather than just browse, thereby also solving the issue of friction in a purchase journey.&lt;br&gt; “India is also recognised as the country with most numbers of mobiles apps installed, which is why app becomes a crucial point of conversion. But with the variety of choices and large number of apps in the market, marketers face the challenge of high abandonment rate of apps after the initial usage. By adopting app retargeting, marketers can boost their in-app engagement strategy and keep up with local, mobilefirst shoppers, thereby offering a great in-app shopping experience to customers. Our endeavour is to help ecommerce companies increase sales; and ensure that shoppers complete a transaction, rather than losing their interest and shifting to another website,” added Dabhade.&lt;br&gt;Sidharth Srinivasan, Head of Digital Marketing, Tata CLiQ, said, “The trend of omnichannel shopping has brought about an opportunity of offering seamless online-to-offline shopping experiences and convenient mobile in-app shopping. Tata CLiQ prides itself as an omnichannel marketplace, combining online and offline shopping to offer a mix of physical and digital shopping experiences. We believe the rise of mobile and in-app shopping means that we must respond as a business and effectively target shoppers with personalised content on mobile apps, thereby ensuring that shoppers are reminded of the Tata CLiQ products they like and return to complete transactions on our app. With the App Advertising through Criteo Dynamic Retargeting, we were able to effectively engage with shoppers and meet our initial targets within a short timeframe. As we experiment with identifying new audiences and positioning ourselves as the go-to platform for all our offerings, Criteo’s support will be vital in making sure we are sharing the right offerings with customers and delivering the best in-app shopping experience nationwide.”</news:description>

      <news:title>Mirror NOW celebrates its journey since its launch</news:title>
      <news:description>Launched in March 2017 with the brand philosophy of ‘You First’, the latest entrant in the English news sense, Mirror NOW, created a new genre of content with a defined purpose of focusing on issues that impact people’s lives. The channel follows one basic principle when it picks up any story - Does it impact daily lives, does it impact families, neighbourhoods? This is the clarity with which the channel operates and works on every news story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537950838_2IQAde_M.K.jpg" style="width:443px;height:294px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;M.K. Anand, MD &amp;amp; CEO, Times Network &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Redefining norms and re-writing the rules for new-age and viewer-centric journalism, the channel prides itself for not taking the beaten path that follows the status-quo and conforms to popular beliefs. When all the other news channels discuss politics and politicians, Mirror NOW debates breaking patriarchy, changing the mindset, pushing for women safety, making sanitary napkins tax free.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537950751_lfDOck_Faye-D%E2%80%99Souza%2C-Executive-Editor%2C-Mirror-NOW-at-the-Mirror-NOW-celebrations-held-in-Gurugram.jpg" style="width:443px;height:294px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Faye D'Souza, Executive Editor, Mirror NOW &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within 1.5 years since its launch, Mirror NOW has not only created a strong resonance with its viewers, it has also risen to No. 3 in the English News Category, leaving behind legacy channels. Some impactful stories include women’s safety through implementation of the anti-child lock in Delhi, exposing the Karnataka rice scam, ensuring relief for the common man through the 2 percent fuel price decrease and influencing the decision of the Government to remove GST on sanitary pads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537950836_9oOfyo_Tanvi-Shukla%2C-News-Editor%2C-Mirror-NOW-at-the-Mirror-NOW-celebrations-held-in-Gurugram.jpg" style="width:443px;height:294px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tanvi Shukla, News Editor, Mirror NOW &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;To celebrate the journey of Mirror NOW and to acknowledge the support from its advertisers, business partners and other associates in Delhi, Mirror NOW hosted a grand celebration at Hotel Leela Ambience, Gurugram.

      <news:title>Five guiding principles to managing a crisis: Ameer Ismail, PointNine Lintas </news:title>
      <news:description>“It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it” said Warren Buffet, and never were truer words spoken.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maintaining a good corporate reputation is becoming increasingly critical with social media and the Internet broadcasting information at the speed of thought. These days, a crisis does not knock, it tweets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, with a focus on quick success, brand and business leaders fail to adopt a strategic approach towards corporate reputation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Corporate reputation has a direct and absolute linkage and impact on business. It is also intrinsically linked to brand and shareholder value. For example, Facebook shares took a major hit and Mark Zuckerberg had doubts cast on his credibility after allegations of user data leaks earlier this year. In our own industry, one of the stalwarts of advertising, Sir Martin Sorrell, had to bring a long and glittering career at WPP to an end after allegations of misconduct were raised, leading to outrage from stockholders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Closer to home, two of the most iconic names in the Indian financial services sector; Chanda Kochhar and Shikha Sharma, have seen themselves embroiled in their own controversies which have had a major negative impact on their respective personal brands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are the five things that organisations should keep in mind to set up the building blocks of a strong crisis management system:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Prepared&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Al Golin, Founder of Golin, famously said, “Fix it before it breaks.” Brands need to start taking pre-emptive measures when it comes to reputation management. As we can see, in cases such as, Mark Zuckerberg and others, when a crisis actually strikes, it is usually too late to do anything about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most effective reaction to a crisis is a carefully coordinated crisis response. Without training, the best crisis planning documents are just a collection of words. Failure to empower employees with the procedures, methods and messages to use in a crisis results in a haphazard response, which will just compound the issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At GolinOpinion, we have initiated a process called Shield to ensure our clients’ crisis teams and response processes leave each session “pressure tested” and ready to respond in the event a crisis does strike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every Crisis Is An Opportunity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Organisations usually take a very defensive approach to crisis response. This attitude is not only outdated, but also risky. A crisis can be an opportunity to relook at how the organisation functions. It can result in the organisation sharpening its saw, figuratively speaking, and actually show itself to be open to change. Effective communications during a crisis depends on a company’s ability to identify opportunities to share its story and correct misinformation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take the case of Taco Bell. In 2011, the fast food chain was sued by an individual claiming it used just 35% beef in its dishes. Though initial outrage was widespread on social media and the claim caused a lot of media scrutiny, Taco Bell took the opportunity to launch a huge social media campaign educating people about the actual ingredients of Taco Bell products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be Decisive&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;An organisation that stands up and speaks during a time of crisis will get more credit for its actions than one that doesn’t. During the FSSAI-Maggie controversy, Nestlé stayed mostly quiet and the story metastasised. To their loyal customers, too, Nestlé appeared paralysed—or worse, guilty. Many Indians took the company’s silence as a sign of wrongdoing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Responding with speed, transparency and integrity is the key. However, do not be in a hurry to get the communication out without giving it enough thought. In her book, Forged In Crisis, Nancy Koehn points at the ability to take a step back and assess the larger picture during a crisis before making a decision as an essential quality that some of the great leaders in history possessed. One cardinal rule to follow is to never treat a crisis as a standalone event. By keeping key stakeholders informed of developments, you can maintain their trust and confidence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicate To Win&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Al Golin said, “In our business, if you play ‘not to lose’ rather than ‘to win’, you will never be a success.” Companies, and their reputations, are no longer safe behind corporate walls simply fending off aggressors. As mentioned earlier, a defensive approach towards crisis management no longer works. At every stage of the crisis, your communication should be transparent, clear and truthful, delivered with confidence. There should be belief that eventually the situation will get mitigated by timely actions. Once a crisis has been resolved, most organisations go back to a normal existence but the ones that win in the end don’t stop communicating and planning for the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn &amp;amp; Reinvent&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you are tied to a crisis, people expect you to take responsibility and be a part of the ultimate solution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Cadbury was hit by a storm after worms were allegedly found in one of its products, it quickly led to one of the most publicised cases and high-profile PR disasters to have taken place in India. Though initially the company denied any problems with its products and even took on the media, as the matter escalated, it quickly changed its approach. Suspending its advertising campaign, it concentrated on educating retailers on safety and hygiene. It took a hard look at its manufacturing and packaging processes and instituted several changes. Today, Cadbury is once again the No.1 in its category in the country. Instead of burying one’s head in the sand, brands should learn and adopt actions that will prevent a recurrence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To conclude, the lesson here is that crises are inevitable but negative backlash can be mitigated and even turned to one’s advantage. These guiding principles mentioned above can provide the direction and framework to ensure that your brand’s reputation is protected at all times.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The author is the&amp;nbsp;President of&amp;nbsp;GolinOpinion &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Chief Growth Officer, PointNine Lintas&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;(Disclaimer: The views expressed here are solely those of the author and do not in any way represent the views of exchange4media.com)&lt;/em&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Video OTT revenue in India expected to reach Rs 13,800 crore by FY 2023 </news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;video  OTT market in India is&#13;
buzzing with competition.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The category has more than&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;30 frontline players,&#13;
including Netflix, Amazon Prime Video India, Hotstar, Sony LIV, Voot, Eros Now and Hooq,&#13;
vying for viewers’ attention. These players will soon be joined by Times&#13;
Internet’s MX Player on September 27 with seven originals. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;The&#13;
OTT revenue in India is expected to grow at a CAGR of 45 per cent to&#13;
reach Rs 13,800 crore by the end of FY23, according to KPMG Media and&#13;
Entertainment Report 2018. Currently, the OTT market stands at Rs 2,150 crore&#13;
(FY 18).&lt;strong&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  Zulfiqar Khan, Managing Director, Hooq, believes that this space will continue to boom for the next 10 years. “All the players are trying to carve out a niche for themselves. They just need to be clear on what play they want to have,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advertisement contributes about 80 per cent of this market (Rs 1,720 crore), while the rest is subscription revenue. By FY23, the subscription revenue is expected to be about 33 per cent of the total revenue at that time, as per the report. Meanwhile, advertisement is projected to grow around 40 per cent CAGR in the next five years to reach Rs 9,300 crore by FY23. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It’s now a serious digital marketing channel for brands who are using it to reach out to their consumers because they are able to get significant scale and reach,” says Uday Sodhi, EVP and Head – Digital Business, Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN) who informed us that SonyLIV has established itself as a “big advertising destination for brands.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Driven by increasing smartphone penetration, improved infrastructure and availability of digital exclusive content, the number of online video viewing audience in India is estimated to be around 225 million in FY18 and is projected to reach 550 million by FY23.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to engagement, the average time spent by subscribers on various OTT platforms varies from 30 to 50 minutes. On YouTube, it is 8-12 minutes, according to KPMG report.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morgan Stanley Research also did a study on the OTT landscape taking into consideration the traffic and engagement time (sourced from Comscore and Morgan Stanley Research). For the month of July, Hotstar took the top spot garnering around 90 million monthly unique viewers (MUVs) with nearly 120 minutes as engagement time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Hotstar’s India Watch Report 2018, 96 per cent of watch time on Hotstar comes from videos which are longer than 20 minutes while one-third of Hotstar subscribers prefer watching their favourite shows on Hotstar compared to television.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Morgan Stanley Research mentioned that for July, Netflix had the highest engagement of more than 120 minutes but their viewer count was around 20 million MUVs. Sony LIV had 30 million MUVs with 60 minutes as engagement (for the same month).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537929476_MPfCEk_ott_morgan.jpg" style="width:443px;height:275px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, given the entry of new players, consolidation is the way to go. Khan is of opinion that there is “more than enough space for more players.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, he mentioned, “Having said that, from a consumer point of view, there is only a certain number of apps he can download on his device. So consolidation will happen faster than TV.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An industry source agrees and believes that the industry will grow at a fast pace. &lt;br&gt;“It’s expected to double in size in the next three years. We will see significant advertising money flow into OTT. Subscription will grow along with the market (growth) or slightly faster. We will see significant growth in the user base,” he said.</news:description>

      <news:title>Oppo appoints Nitin Yadav to lead its Public Relations division in South Asia</news:title>
      <news:description>Nitin Yadav, former Public Relations Manager at Huawei Technologies and Manager, Press Relations and Corporate Affairs, Vivo has joined Oppo Mobiles to lead its Public Relations in South Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both Oppo and Vivo have lately been in the&amp;nbsp;news for their big media spends. According to some reports, the two Chinese Smartphone manufacturers allocated a combined sum of Rs 2200 crore for their marketing spends in 2017 alone. Both&amp;nbsp;players are competing to have a dominant position in the&amp;nbsp;smartphone&amp;nbsp;market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yadav’s role also assumes significance since Xiaomi has emerged as a tough competitor to Oppo and has captured significant market share in the last one year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Oppo had 5.6% smartphone share in the first quarter of 2018, down from 9.9% share during a year earlier period, according to Counterpoint research. Xiaomi maintained its lead in Q1 with 31.1% market share, followed by Samsung (26.2%) and Vivo (5.8%).</news:description>

      <news:title>WATCH: ‘With digital, growth of content marketing has accelerated’: Kranti Gada</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Bloomberg Quint Initiative&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good quality content is key to customer acquisition, thereby driving sales and RoI for a brand. Content marketing is the heart of most successful campaigns, and more so digital these days. Every prosperous brand has a relevant and valuable story to narrate that immediately connects with the brand’s audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kranti Gada, Chief Operating Officer at Shemaroo Entertainment Ltd. speaks on&amp;nbsp;how the digital platform has led to the rapid growth in content marketing. Kranti further explained as to how with the use of digital, it beomes easier for brands to segment their target audience and accordingly customise content format. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to her, a meaningful story for consumers not only enables them to become a part of the brand’s media but also helps drive RoI for that particular brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She shared her insights on content marketing with exchang4media, noting that a content strategy is critical to brands in the current ecosystem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edited Excerpts: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What according to you are the key aspects of a good content marketing strategy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best content marketing strategy is that it should not look like marketing. It should be an integral piece of the content conveying a meaningful story and a significant proposition to the consumer, attracting users' attention naturally. If content marketing can achieve its relevance with consumers without actually having the need to sell the idea to users, a larger purpose will be served. Good content marketing fulfills the real need of either being entertained or informed with the product being weaved in colourlessly into the entire story.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content marketing can help reduce your overall marketing costs. Do you agree?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marketing has 2 aspects, one being what is spent on creative and the other talks about the expenditure on media. In the investment proportions probably 10 per cent is invested in creative while the other 90 per cent is on media. If the creative content in itself is of high quality, then its effectiveness in delivery on the same media plan is massive. Similarly, in content marketing if the content has turned out to be really good, then your consumer himself will turn out to be your media thereby driving RoI. It is crucial to understand, the multiplier effect a good content piece can provide us with in order to leverage and maximise the impact on media. The advantage of content marketing also lies in its format, wherein one has the freedom to build ads and ideas longer than 30 second creatives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see the transition of branded content or content marketing from what it was 5 years ago to what it is now?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital as a platform has really evolved in the last 5 years. Content marketing before this was largely distributed to either television or the radio medium. Now, with digital providing a wider reach, one can easily segment the target audience and customise campaign content accordingly. Digital with time, will provide us with even bigger a platform to innovate and creatively perform story telling for the advertisers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is traditional content marketing being left out in the Digital push?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even today, the impact of traditional media is huge for digital to effect it in a big way. Having said that, the advantages of digital media in terms of targeting and innovation are way higher. Traditional media on the other hand is infact catching up by producing several innovative ad formats. Digital cannot match the reach and noticeability that traditional media can provide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not only TV but also the resurgence of print along with the impact of outdoors, traditional media has been thoroughly impactful. Even digital media today is making use of outdoors to create an influencer effect, as beyond a point there’s also a blindspot in digital. While digital forcing traditional media to be innovative, I think it still has a place of its own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Idea's #MeriRealLife ad campaign: Yet another great Idea, Sirji?</news:title>
      <news:description>Addressing the growing phenomenon of the need for validation on social media, brand Idea recently launched a campaign titled #MeriRealLife, encouraging people to drop the pressure of chasing and sharing perfection on social media, and instead, share real, unfiltered stories using Idea 4G.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign went live with the first two TVCs aired during the Live matches of Asia Cup Cricket Tournament. The brand released a series of three TVCs of 40 and 35 seconds duration capturing the concept through the lens of three people from different walks of life, sharing how their social media lives are different from their real lives. The ads show people talking about a fancy new car, the perfect look and relationship goals on their social media while in their real lives they are questioning their own shallow behaviour. The videos end with the characters having their moment of reckoning, where they encourage the world to share their real photos and videos with #MeriRealLife.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new Idea campaign has been developed by BBDO India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign will be promoted on TV, Radio and Digital through high decibel visibility across 100+ TV Channels and strategic integrations in shows/programs such as 'Film Companion' by Anupama Chopra on digital, and popular radio shows ‘Heart to Heart with Meera’ and ‘Calling Karan’ on Ishq/Love 104.8 etc&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Says team Vodafone-Idea, “As a thought leader, Idea believes that we need to propagate a culture of ‘Responsible use of Social Media’. With this latest campaign, Idea wants to elevate the role of Idea 4G beyond the category conversation to something that reflects its transformative role in people’s lives and society.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Josy Paul, Chief Creative Officer &amp;amp; Chairman, BBDO India contends that content is nothing without context and so, the core idea for the creative communication was founded on a new-world conflict that needed urgent attention. “The Idea brand is about transformation – ‘An Idea can change your life’. It’s the pressure that social media and the constant need for external validation is putting on people. It’s the elephant in the room, the hidden truth. All we did was create a platform to counter this growing pressure. To create a world that’s more real. #MeriRealLife. It’s simple, empowering and transformative. It’s something that is aligned to brand Idea’s way of looking at the world,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ad review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aditya Kilpady, National Planning Director, Dentsu Impact feels that Idea has been bold to take a contrarian point-of-view to be real and responsible on social media. “Camera phone brands have created the pressure of chasing perfection on social media and gaining instant fame and recognition. The communication is simple and fresh. I am keen to see how they have taken the #MeriRealLife thought beyond a television ad, into social media where the real test lies,” points out Kilpady. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deepak Singh, Chief Creative Officer, The Social Street opines that the approach of saying ‘be as you are or be yourself’ has already been explored by many brands. “The execution style of testimonials is also not new. And more importantly, I feel that if the ad was all about glorifying imperfection, the models should have been dressed and portrayed like simple and imperfect characters, which could have made the ad look more real,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vibhor Yadav, Creative Director, Isobar appreciates Idea’s approach backed with purpose-led advertising. “It has worked for them earlier, and I am sure it will again. With the Idea-Vodafone merger, it’s imperative for the biggest player to go beyond product level and talk about some positive change. Based on a very relatable consumer insight of dual life, I believe, this campaign will make its way to the consumer’s mind,” asserts Yadav.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Axon Alex, Head of Strategy, The 120 Media Collective echoes the sentiment that the larger theme of sharing your real selves and ignoring pressures of social media perfection is one that has been talked about before, but the depth Idea has touched on with the personal stories is what makes it stand out. However, Alex remarks, “I just felt the execution could’ve been better highlighting this depth of the other side of ‘perfection’. It felt too manufactured which reduces the impact of the message. I like that they took this topic where there is a clear role for the brand as well as something that- in line with the brands rich advertising history, leaves you with food for thought.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LC6CbRAS9FI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQbmZjiXdSI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Being an 'influencer' is now a full-fledged career choice</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By Dessidre Fleming&#13;
&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537953603_jFMoVR_youthculturelogo.jpg" style="width:200px;height:204px;float:left"&gt;Almost every Instagram&#13;
account will have ‘influencer’ and ‘public figure’ - a term that used to be&#13;
reserved to the likes of Malala Yousufzai and Oprah Winfrey - plastered in its&#13;
bio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today,&#13;
anyone with a smartphone, internet connection and just an Instagram handle can&#13;
become an influencer. One doesn’t even need a blue tick. But, in case they do,&#13;
the app just made it a possibility for everyone, too. Judging by the fact that&#13;
today the influencer ‘game’ is actually a $1.6 billion strong industry in 2018&#13;
alone - and that figure is estimated to jump to $2.38 billion in 2019 - I think&#13;
it’s safe to say that being an influencer is no child’s play anymore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
“While this varies a lot on multiple parameters that includes&#13;
reach, engagement with the followers, demographics you reach out to and the&#13;
impact you have on that audience, in the current scenario, influencers can make&#13;
anything from INR 20,000 to INR 15-25 lakhs for each brand engagement on social&#13;
media,” says Gurpreet Singh, Founder, One Digital Entertainment.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;strong&gt;“Currently,&#13;
I have about 750K followers on Instagram, most of whom are teenagers. It has&#13;
taken me about 3 years to get to where I am today,” says Prajakta Koli,&#13;
Instagrammer, Influencer and YouTube sensation.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537953879_XgfvQO_inside-image-1.jpg" style="width:150px;height:223px;float:right"&gt;“Numbers don’t grow&#13;
overnight. One has to work consistently and put out regular content posts which&#13;
starts getting you a steady stream of followers,” she adds.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
“For an Instagram influencer having more than 100k followers&#13;
and unique content ideas, the earning per month can vary from Rs 50,000 to Rs&#13;
2,00,000,” reveals Nitika Whig Bhatia who signed up for an Instagram account as&#13;
an Influencer in 2012.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;strong&gt;“In most&#13;
cases, influencers get to charge as per their following, engagement, reach and&#13;
clout. The bigger the influencer, the bigger the budget. One can spend anywhere&#13;
from INR 10,000 to lakhs of rupees for a single post,” says Pankhuri&#13;
Harikrishnan, Owner and Director, Fetch Consulting.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;“Almost 50 to 60% percent&#13;
of our business is tailor-made around curating influencers for brands,” she&#13;
reveals.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537953998_AwMFvN_inside-Prajakta-Koli.jpg" style="width:150px;height:120px;float:right"&gt;“I charge anywhere between Rs 20,000 to Rs&#13;
1,00,000 per post and I earn anywhere between Rs 50,000 and 3,00,000 in a month&#13;
from my stint as an influencer in the tech space,” says Faizan Patel, a well-known&#13;
fashion, lifestyle and wedding photographer with an Instagram following of&#13;
14,000 and growing.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
“While the concept of influencer marketing is a well-placed&#13;
formula abroad, in India, brands are now starting to open up to the idea. We&#13;
interact with at least 20 - 30 new and upcoming influencers on a monthly&#13;
basis,” says Varun Pratap, Founder &amp;amp; Owner, Quirk Communications.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
Clearly, it doesn’t take much to be an influencer while the&#13;
long-term returns seem to be a lot more lucrative than a steady day job, to be&#13;
honest.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537954074_8WV9Cn_inside-image-boy.jpg" style="width:150px;height:230px;float:right"&gt;The simplest case in point would be Instagram&#13;
poets like Nikita Gill - with 1,44,000 followers - and Rupi Kaur - with 3&#13;
million followers - who decided to start out on their own, despite the fact&#13;
that publishers had rejected them. Today, they have created a brand for&#13;
themselves through their IG accounts - not to forget the publishing houses and&#13;
magazines that now queue up to feature them.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&#13;
The only trick to the game is to post regularly and&#13;
unfailingly; influencers usually devise a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 12&#13;
Instagram posts a day to keep the engagement going. While the idea is to create&#13;
unique content, it usually is a balanced out mix of posts that have potential&#13;
to go viral and posts tick off Instagram’s own checklist - good images, geo&#13;
tags, relevant hashtags and videos whenever possible.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;American poet,&#13;
Allen Ginsberg once said, “Whoever controls the media, the images, controls the&#13;
culture.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537954169_Z4ehqa_inside-image-bottom.jpg" style="width:150px;height:220px;float:right"&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today, that ‘whoever’ is known as an influencer. Our world has become&#13;
smaller, thanks to the internet. And we’ve become more connected - even to the&#13;
most inaccessible, unavailable and unaffordable experiences - through&#13;
influencers. In a way, it seems to be the need of the hour as masses are more&#13;
open to embracing real inspirational figures who stem from within society.&#13;
Nevertheless, looks like your friendly Insta feed Influencer is here to stay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Fastrack tells youth not to be a ‘loser’ in its latest campaign by Lowe Lintas  </news:title>
      <news:description>Fastrack has recently launched the latest version of its popular wearable activity tracker 'Fastrack Reflex 2.0'. To promote it, Lowe Lintas Bangalore has conceived a quirky campaign film.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new Fastrack Reflex 2.0 is a feature-packed activity tracker that boasts of a 'Phone Finder' feature. The campaign idea amplifies the feature and flirts with the fear and anxiety of the youth about losing the smartphone, using parables to proclaim 'Don't be a loser!'&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suparna Mitra, Chief Marketing Officer, Titan, said "The mere thought of losing our phone sends all of us into a panic frenzy. And the perfect solution to this is Reflex 2.0’s phone finder feature. While the smart band has other new features, we thought this would be an interesting take to appeal to the growing number of smart wearable users of today."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In its usual unconventional 'Fastrack' way, the campaign film by Lowe Lintas Bangalore shows the distress people experience in the moments when they think that they’ve lost their phone, making them feel like complete and utter ‘losers’. The Reflex 2.0 puts an end to their grief with its new Phone Finder feature that instantly locates the 'lost' phone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the campaign, Arun Iyer, Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, Lowe Lintas, said "The idea came from a very simple insight, our world seems to fall apart in the moments just after we realise we’ve lost our phone. We are inconsolable and feel like a ‘loser’ in every sense of the word.  We decided to have a bit of fun and showcase how with the Fastrack Reflex 2.0 you never have to feel like a loser again."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hari Krishnan, President – South, Lowe Lintas, said "Normal words have a different meaning in the youth context and that’s why there is a normal dictionary and an urban dictionary.  In its typical, quirky way, Fastrack has explored the world of ‘losers’ in the context of a new feature on Fastrack Reflex 2.0 that helps locate a lost handset. We’re confident this won’t be lost on the Fastrack consumer."&lt;br&gt;The campaign will be live online and offline.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzK_KgbUsmc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Nova Eyewear’s latest campaign has Jacqueline Fernandez showcasing the brand’s collection</news:title>
      <news:description>Nova Eyewear, the global brand from Vision Rx Lab, has launched a TVC featuring actress Jacqueline Fernandez. Fernandez is the brand’s global ambassador. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a statement issued by the company, the TVC shows how the wide category of eye-care products from Nova Eyewear, spanning advanced digital lenses to fashionable frames and sunglasses, play an important role in the life of today’s active individuals to complement their personal style and fulfil their eye-care needs of clear vision. The TVC also portrays how Nova Eyewear protects the eyes from harmful UV rays and filters the junk light throughout the day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The TVC portrays a story which starts with how Fernandez gets ready in stylish Nova glasses to match her office attire. The campaign also captures how the photochromic lenses turns dark and adapt to light condition when she steps out in the daylight, protecting her from harmful UV rays and excess glare.  The story seamlessly moves forward to show how she uses Nova lenses with HD clarity inside her office to remain focused with sharp precision. Even while playing the dart game with her colleagues she successfully aims the bull’s eye because of visual clarity offered by the lenses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The collection further accentuates Fernandez’s look where she is riding a horse wearing UV protected Nova sunglasses which come with dust &amp;amp; scratch resistant coating followed by a scene at the beach where she is seen basking in the sun wearing Nova polarised sunglasses with anti-glare properties which block the blinding light under the sun. In addition to the sunglasses, it highlights blue-light filter lenses from Nova worn by her while she is watching movies/videos on her personal electronic device, which allows her to enjoy strain-free vision by blocking harmful blue-light emitted by the digital screens. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on this occasion, Pammi Jamalpuria, VP- Corporate Marketing, Vision Rx Lab said, “We take great pride in introducing Nova Eyewear’s latest TVC featuring our first ever global brand ambassador Jacqueline Fernandez. A famous face synonymous with international fashion, well known for her great sense of fashion and dynamic lifestyle, Jacqueline perfectly represents Nova’s complete range of eye-care solutions (lens, frames &amp;amp; powered sunglasses) which come with sheer sophistication and style and effectively address the day to day need for clear vision and protection required for leading an active lifestyle. We are sure that Jacqueline’s association with Nova will not only help to elevate the regular style codes of the generation but also make them aware about the advanced vision solutions that are available to them under a single brand.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wi_C95Lko_0" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Instagram founders quit following disagreements with Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg</news:title>
      <news:description>The founders of Instagram are leaving Facebook Inc. after growing tensions with Chief Executive Officer, Mark Zuckerberg over the direction of the app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom built Instagram and sold it to Facebook for $715 million six years ago. Instagram, which now has more than one billion users, is a key driver of revenue for Facebook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; “Mike and I are grateful for the last eight years at Instagram and six years with the Facebook team. We’ve grown from 13 people to over a thousand with offices around the world, all while building products used and loved by a community of over one billion. We’re now ready for our next chapter,” read a blog post.&lt;br&gt;“We’re planning on taking some time off to explore our curiosity and creativity again. Building new things requires that we step back, understand what inspires us and match that with what the world needs; that’s what we plan to do,” added the blog post.&lt;br&gt;Without the founders around, Instagram is likely to become more tightly integrated with Facebook, making it more of a product division within the larger company than a separate app, say news reports.&lt;br&gt;“We remain excited for the future of Instagram and Facebook in the coming years as we transition from leaders to two users in a billion. We look forward to watching what these innovative and extraordinary companies do next,” said the blog post.</news:description>

      <news:title>You Cannot Buy Customers With Heavy Discounts: Uma Talreja, Shoppers Stop</news:title>
      <news:description>At a time when e-commerce seems to be the order of the day, Uma Talreja, Customer Care Associate, Chief of Marketing &amp;amp; Customer Officer, Shoppers Stop Limited tells us how the brand’s greatest strengths lie in being a formidable retail player with solid partner relationships and a strong customer base.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wardrobe Refresh is&amp;nbsp;your first marketing campaign with you having recently joined Shoppers Stop. Tell us about your marketing strategy. What are the focus areas going to be, with the rollout of this campaign?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is in fact about two months since I joined Shoppers Stop, so these are still early days to talk strategy. I joined the company just before the festive season and my plan is to look at what we can do to leverage customer sentiment during this season. So yes, my first Wardrobe Refresh campaign represents everything that Shoppers’ Stop stands for, while also bringing in an element of newness to our communication. I have also closely studied our customer profiles over the time that I have been here and what I have found is that our core audience is still very strong, and almost 75% of revenue still comes from the loyalty base, the First Citizen customer base. One of the missing audiences in Shoppers Stop today, considering the brand mix we have is the youth. So, the campaign is really talking about how you can refresh your wardrobe in time for the festive season, but is also youthful in its appeal. It specifically talks to people who are fashion forward. We also have various brands partnering with us for the Wardrobe Refresh, so are looking forward to a good response from customers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside from the campaign, what else do you have lined up for the brand?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the things we have looked at is restructuring the team into verticals across the marketing function such as communications, loyalty, digital, etc. We have looked at how we can bring a lot of things together in terms of work streams. So, content as a stream should cut across everything that we do and that is the first change we are making. We are looking at analytics not just as a value-added service but also in terms of retail and merchandising. We want to make sure that we integrate what we have and that we consolidate work streams and spends, while also strengthening individual roles. That way, everyone is empowered to create real value. This is especially important this year because when we actually scale up in a year or two, we need to be well prepared to take on the larger market. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In terms of scaling up, can you tell us more about the brand’s expansion plans?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;At this point we are expanding our stores gradually, but I am sure that will change in the future because the market is big for different formats and variations. We have a wealth of opportunities in fact because we retail so many categories. So I don’t have specifics to tell you in terms of scaling up, but Shoppers Stop has several strengths whether it is in our partner relationships or in our consumer base. These strengths will really help us grow, and we plan to leverage them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shoppers Stop typically adopts a range of ATL and BTL activations, and interactive marketing to drive brand awareness. Will you continue with this strategy, or will that change?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;You know, a lot of times you do tend to use a marketing mix that is consistent in order to reach consumers at various touch points even more so now, with the growth of Digital. For this campaign, we definitely are using TV because that gives you the benefit of reach. Going forward I see a lot more focus on data and digital. We already do a lot of online marketing, through our own website shoppersstop.com. Another thing we want to focus on is content marketing because we actually have a lot to say to our customers that can help them. Moreover, people are looking for that kind of information and given the number of brands we have, we can fill that information gap. Today, with both TV and OTT coming together as platforms, there is enough opportunity to leverage content creatively and differently. Currently, about 10 to 12 per cent of our ad spends are devoted to Digital and e-commerce. That number will definitely increase to about 25 per cent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As one of India’s first departmental stores, how are you handling stiff competition from e-commerce fashion/lifestyle portals like Myntra? How do you compete with their heavy discounts?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes of course, customers choose to shop online and that is no longer a revelation. E-commerce is convenient, a compelling proposition and it is price sensitive. The more important question we need to ask is what motivates a customer’s choice when it comes to shopping. At the end of the day, if we want to show our appreciation and loyalty to our customers, then we need to dig deeper to know what they are looking for and create an experience that leaves them delighted. We in fact have a strategic partnership with Amazon, something we entered into just around a year ago. So Shoppers Stop is available both on Amazon and our own site, Shoppersstop.com. Between these, our online strategy is pretty robust. Though&amp;nbsp;this is just a starting point for us, there is plenty of room to grow. We have several advantages as a brand also because we are an offline player. You cannot buy customers with heavy discounts! In fact, many online players are actually looking at physical retail. So really, we just have to play to our strengths when it comes to competition.</news:description>

      <news:title>Print industry sees 2% decline in ad volume in 2018: TAM data</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;The print industry, it seems, is&amp;nbsp;still reeling under the impact of&amp;nbsp;the double blow of demonetization and GST. According to TAM Media Research data, the ad volume across print industry witnessed a decline of 2 per cent in January-June 2018 as&amp;nbsp;compared to January-June 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figure represents the combined indexed growth in top 10 advertising categories for the period of January-June 2018. These categories are: two-wheeler, car/jeep, coaching/competitive exam centre, multiple courses, real estate, hospital/clinic, retail outlet-electronics, school, retail outlet-clothing and retail outlet-jewellers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;Industry players attribute this slump to several factors, including the after-effects of demonetization and GST.  The figure represents the combined indexed growth in top 10 advertising categories for the period of January-June 2018. These categories are: two-wheeler, car/jeep, coaching/competitive exam centre, multiple courses, real estate, hospital/clinic, retail outlet-electronics, school, retail outlet-clothing and retail outlet-jewellers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537925337_Nox84D_tam_inside.jpg" style="width:443px;height:239px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Industry players attribute this slump to several factors, including the after-effects of demonetization and GST.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There is no denying the fact that overall volumes were affected. This happened due to multiple factors, including the after-effects of demonetization and GST, coupled with an overall macroeconomic and other seasonal trends. Brands were cautious in their marketing plans with regard to campaigns and preferred to focus on specific customer-led topical initiatives, which led to reduced budgets for the print,” says PM Balakrishna, Business Head- National Accounts, The Hindu.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Balakrishna believes that H2 should rebound strongly with overall macroeconomic sentiment picking up and most companies now seeing the benefits of GST compliance. &lt;br&gt;“Companies are now planning to unveil their launches and brand campaigns and print will be a very critical medium to boost sales and customer awareness for these campaigns. Print has always been the preferred medium for offers and schemes during the festive period. And with the festive window being slightly larger this time compared to last year, the industry is expected to see a much more buoyant quarter and year ahead,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An industry observer expressed similar thoughts. “January- June 2017 was immediately post demonetization and companies were holding their budgets. Advertisers had become more conscious about their spends and had started spending more on TV and digital to reach maximum number of people. Print also gives you reach, but it is far more expensive than other mediums. Print is very important for a strategic advertising,” said the observer, who did not wished to be named. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As per the recent KPMG report, the print sector witnessed a significant adverse impact due to the after effects of demonetization, coupled with a weak advertising demand due to implementation of GST and RERA. This resulted in a growth rate of 3.4 per cent during FY18, which was the lowest in a decade. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the ad volumes, a senior executive from HT Media said, “The print industry is going through a difficult phase. Newsprint price hike has also hit us badly.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the list of top 10 categories, car/ jeep segment has seen a dip of 14 per cent, while the coaching segment has grown by 6 per cent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vinita Shah, Head-Marketing, Business Development &amp;amp; Analytics for TAM Axis and TAM Sports, explained, “If you compare the top 10 categories of January-June 2017 with January-June 2018, there is not much difference. Also, the storyline gets different when festival season starts. You will see more retail advertising coming in.”</news:description>

      <news:title>Meet the new chief of Facebook India</news:title>
      <news:description>Putting end to months of speculation Facebook on Monday evening announced that Hotstar CEO Ajit Mohan has been roped in for the top job at Facebook India. Mohan will assume the newly created role of Managing Director for India, a VP-level role, early next year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his 20 year long career Mohan has worked across media companies and management consultancies, including a brief stint at The Wall Street Journal as a columnist for the business newspaper. Of all the positions he has held, he is best known for shaping and building Hotstar, the Over-The-Top (OTT) offering from the Star stable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537844194_ABI65M_Ajit_Mohan_Facebook.jpg" alt="Hotstar CEO Ajit Mohan Join Facebook India as MD &amp;amp; VP" title="Hotstar CEO Ajit Mohan Join Facebook India as MD &amp;amp; VP"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the digital maverick at Star India, Mohan launched what would be the beta version of Hotstar - starsports.com - in 2013. A man who has always been a thought leader in the industry envisioned a platform that turned into the primary online destination to watch Live Sports content. By 2014, starsports.com had amassed 28 million Daily Active Users who were watching 45 minutes of content. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starsports.com morphed into Hotstar in 2015 under Mohan’s stewardship. The platform which had had a meteoric rise in the first two years of its launch was set to break all viewership records as the platform and the consumption habits of the Indian internet user changed. Mohan is credited for the success of Hotstar which is the undoubted leader in the OTT space in India with 150 million Monthly Active Users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his previous avatars, Mohan has been a Management Consultant in the Media and Entertainment discipline at McKinsey and Company, New York. Later as a Fellow at the McKinsey Global Institute, Mohan studied India’s urban explosion and did research on ‘Building Inclusive Cities and Sustaining Economic Growth’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mohan earned his MBA in Finance from The Wharton School. In addition to studying finance, Mohan pursued an MA in Economics and International Relations from Johns Hopkins University. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mohan will take on his new role at Facebook India in the new year. As MD and VP Facebook India, Mohan will report to David Fischer, VP Global Business and Marketing Partnerships. In the past the head of the India operations has always reported to the Singapore office that controls all of APAC operations, but in a departure to that structure, Mohan will be reporting to a senior leader based in Menlo Park.</news:description>

      <news:title>Jio wanted to change everything in no time: Borja Borrero, Interbrand</news:title>
      <news:description>It was not so long ago when brands were seemingly powerful. Any inconvenient truths were hidden by glossy packaging and one-way, big-bang marketing campaigns. But over time, consumers have become more aware, creating a challenge for many brand owners. Most companies are recognising the way perceptions are changing and are adapting their branding strategies accordingly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Borja Borrero, Executive Creative Director, EMEA &amp;amp; LatAm, Interbrand, who has lent his expertise to the likes of Jio and Britannia believes that how a brand looks is not as important as what it delivers. In a chat with exchange4media, Borrero talks about working with a legacy brand like Britannia, why the brief from Jio challenged him and everything branding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the video or read the edited excerpts&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MAvvoeDQHrg" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Borrero started working with Interbrand, one of the world's leading brand consultancies, 15 years ago. He has been in charge of several international projects, including the historic transformation of Iberia Airlines and the repositioning of the brand as well as the introduction of DIA, La Plaza and Clarel. “I was actually attracted to Interbrand because they were the ones who actually coined the term ‘branding’. And over time, they have been creating and managing the biggest brands in the world,” he confesses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about how the agency has grown its roots worldwide, Borrero reveals that when Interbrand started off in 1974, it was just a naming agency. “Interbrand grew its portfolio of services to become the big consultancy that it is today,” he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are seeing big disruption in the branding field. Branding started off as an exercise of identification and little by little it became more sophisticated. We realised that brands are tangible assets that have value. And this value can be calculated following some formulas. So it’s not so important how the brand looks but it’s about what it delivers. As we evolve across these various stages, we can also see the branding discipline evolving,” he continues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Borrero is of the opinion that being an agile brand today is the need of the hour. “The world is getting more and more rapid, complex and agile. Brands have to adapt and change. Or even go faster so that they can anticipate what their consumer wants. The strongest brand is not the one that necessarily changes all the time but the one that knows how to adapt to the changing environment,” he advises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Borrero was involved in sourcing the international creative team in creating the brand identity for telecom giant Jio. “The first thing with Jio was that we wanted to create an international creative team to work with the brand because we wanted to create one iconic brand for India that can be a disruptor and be relevant even beyond the boundaries of India. The brand wanted to change everything in no time. So we had to be agile, flexible and very fast,” he reveals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming back to working with iconic Indian brands, Britannia is another one Borrero has worked closely with. “It was an interesting project. The client knew what they wanted but the process was long because it took us almost one year. When you’re dealing with brands that have such a legacy, it takes time to realise where to go, how to go about it without betraying the history and foundations of the brand. We had to be mindful of the cultural components. But then again, you need to incorporate for the brand, the renewed visions for the time to come. On top of that, we knew that Britannia was creating a bigger portfolio of products by adding dairy products too. So communicating it was challenging. And now, we are in the process of materialising this change through the branding exercise,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about how a branding exercise is essentially different from an advertising campaign, he opines that with technology, consumers know what they want and advertising is seen as something that comes in the way of their lives. “It is really tricky to connect with consumers nowadays and is just getting trickier. To me, branding is very tactical. It works in the long term while advertising works in a shorter timeframe. Branding is very strategic and sits very close to what the company wants to do,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is often said that a lot of good marketing money is spent on advertising and not brand building. Does the branding maestro agree that it is true with companies today? Borrero gives a nod. “Branding is very deep and deploying branding takes copy-writers, designers, motion-graphics, etc. It requires many disciplines integrated and orchestrated to deliver a proper experience. And, at times, we feel that branding is not well-valued among a couple of brands,” he contends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Around the India-scheme of things, when we quiz him if branding is getting the desired importance from brands and marketers, he says it’s just getting better. “India is very complex because you have a huge population. There is a huge challenge around how to address every level of the population. When we see clients like Infosys, Jio, Britannia, we’re seeing that big branding exercises and budgets are being utilised. Some companies see that their competitors are investing in this, which motivates them too. This will accelerate the process. We’re seeing a lot of progress. Interbrand in India has grown dramatically over the last five years. We’ve tripled our team here and are working with the biggest names. I see a promising future,” explains Borrero.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He believes that the challenge into the future is to offer seamless experience to the consumer. “We’re moving into experience-oriented branding consultancy where we still integrate strategy and creative in 50 per cent weight. So into the future, we will be evolving. We are integrating and incorporating ways and methodologies that will help the consumer at the center stage,” he shares.</news:description>

      <news:title>Samsung India's new campaign highlights capabilities of digital voice assistant, Bixby</news:title>
      <news:description>Samsung India has launched a digital campaign showcasing the capabilities of its digital voice assistant – Bixby through a powerful narrative that strikes a chord with viewers. The film is inspired by the life of a Motor Neuron Disease (MND)/ALS patient Sonal (name changed) who agreed to let Samsung work on a pilot project to help preserve her voice forever for her daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign shows a loving mother who is diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease (MND)/ALS and is losing her voice and ability to move, and how Samsung customises its AI enabled Bixby technology to keep her voice alive on a Samsung smartphone so that her loved ones can continue to hear her voice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the pilot phase of the project, Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore (SRI-B) worked with a company which specializes in core speech technologies. We recorded an independent voice, and using TTS (Text To Speech) technology tested that voice for compatibility on Android OS (Samsung Smartphone). Testing on Tizen OS (Refrigerator, Television) is under progress. This phase led to the discovery of Asha Ek Hope Foundation, the first registered NGO for MND/ALS in India. It is a non-profit organisation supporting people with motor neuron disease (MND) and their families. It’s striving to infuse hope and positivity in their life, which will empower them to overcome the illness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“At Samsung, we are focused on transforming people’s lives with innovative technologies. The endeavour is to solve real-life problems of consumers through meaningful innovations. This film depicts how Samsung can make the seemingly impossible, possible by using its AI voice assistant, Bixby to preserve the voice of a mother who is diagnosed with MND,” said Mr. Ranjivjit Singh, Chief Marketing Officer, Samsung India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the film, the daughter is seen reading out an essay at school where she describes the beautiful relationship with her mother. She crafts a narrative which celebrates the mother-daughter bond through activities, just the two of them spending time together, listening to and laughing with one another. As the video continues streaming, the mother is missing from the picture and we see the daughter speaking to a phone with her father in the backdrop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Samsung, the leader in innovations, is always looking for ways to help people do the impossible. We are developing the first ever personalized AI voice assistant - Bixby to help people affected by Motor Neuron Disease leave their voices for their loved ones before they lose it. Cheil team set out to present a simple yet moving film, inspired by a true story, showcasing the endless possibilities that Bixby can bring to the family coping with this unfortunate condition. We are delighted to see the heartwarming response that the film is getting and we are looking forward to perfecting the technology and inspiring many others.” added, Josh Seokjin, Sr. Art Director &amp;amp; Alberto Rodriguez, Sr. Copywriter from Cheil HQ Global Creative Division.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samsung believes in delivering connected consumer experiences across its spectrum of products and has been focused on cutting edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Virtual Reality (VR), Machine learning and 5G mobile networks. It spent more than $14 billion on R&amp;amp;D globally last year and has more than 65,000 engineers and designers working to innovate and, bring the best products and solutions for our consumers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The launch of the world’s largest mobile factory in Noida is testimony to its strong commitment to Indian consumers. Following the launch of the factory, was the opening of the Company’s largest mobile experience centre in Bengaluru’s iconic Opera House. This centre showcases differentiated product experiences that revolve around transformative technologies such as VR, AI and IoT, which Samsung is pioneering globally. The customized Bixby voice solution is another example of Samsung’s commitment towards its consumers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the video:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>DD FreeDish to announce e-auction date soon &#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537843828_nQYRAf_freedish_graphic.jpg" style="width:266px;height:374px;float:right"&gt;After a year-long wait, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is believed to have given a green signal to e-auctioning of slots for DD FreeDish. The auction was suspended in October last year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Highly placed sources informed exchange4media that the decision was taken 15 days ago and the ministry is expected to announce the auction date by this week. However, there has been no official communication to the broadcasters from the ministry yet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the suspension of the auction in October 2017, when Smriti Irani was heading the ministry, Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) had directed public broadcaster Prasar Bharati to carry channels whose contract had expired or was about to expire on a pro-rata basis until it comes up with a new business model. The channels that are available on a pro-rata basis pay the subscription fee on a monthly basis. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last e-auction took place in July 2017, in which DD-Freedish had earned Rs 85.10 crore and had awarded slots to 11 private broadcasters. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As reported, almost 50 of the 60 channels on DD FreeDish cater to the Hindi region. It is expected that Doordarshan will open a different category for regional channels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the auction, an industry observer said, “They should not increase the base price because then it will become unbearable. Secondly, if they want to give space to regional broadcasters, the base price for them could be different because they are smaller channels.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is believed that DD will review the base price, which is currently around Rs 8 crore. Industry experts say if the auction starts off with this base point, smaller broadcasters might go off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A senior executive with a leading broadcaster said, “As of now, we haven't received any invitation from Doordarshan. As and when we know about it, we will take a call whether we want to be there or not.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, the broadcasters are waiting for the new tariff regime which is expected to be out on September 25, 2018.</news:description>

      <news:title>Johnson’s Baby shoots new campaign with 44 real families</news:title>
      <news:description>JOHNSON’S Baby has launched a new campaign – “Choose Gentle”, aimed at millennial parents. The campaign highlights the changes that JOHNSON’s has made to include fewer ingredients to give even more gentle care. The TVC represents millennial parents in India a glimpse of their lives showcasing the trend of co-parenting and sharing equal responsibilities. The TVC also highlights the changing product attributes like no parabens, no sulphates and no dyes to give the gentlest care to babies whilst maintaining the core of ‘clinically proven, pure ingredients’. The products also have a new packaging.&lt;br&gt;The campaign has been shot with 44 real families – Mums, dads, babies, siblings and grandparents. &lt;br&gt;Speaking about the new campaign, Dimple Sidhar, Vice - President, Marketing at Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Consumer India, said, “Johnson’s Baby has been with mums in every step of their journey of parenting. This campaign highlights that we continue to do so, moving forward with changing times. As parenting has evolved in India, so have the needs of the new age parents in taking care of their bundle of joy. The TVC lauds Millennial mothers who are adeptly balancing multiple roles as also recognizes the increasing role fathers are playing in baby care today.”&lt;br&gt;The ad film is directed by Benaifer Mallik and co-director Rajiv Rajamani who have had a long- standing relationship with the brand and have created nearly 100 TV commercials for Johnson’s Baby, across borders.&lt;br&gt;Benaifer Mallik shared her thoughts on directing the video, saying, “After having completed nearly 100 TVCs for Johnson’s Baby in different countries it seemed like we’d been there and done everything! Then the Choose Gentle project threw up a challenge for us. Johnson’s Baby India was reinventing itself and we needed to capture the essence of that change. What inspired us to craft the narratives was meeting up with millennial parents from diverse backgrounds who seemed to profess so much confidence in the brand. And in a week when the monsoon’s fury was at its peak, over 50 families with their babies turned up for the shoot over 7 days and participated in a candid recording of the parent – baby experience of a whole new generation.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KvrDJZuV-xI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWo6dYNHzrQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>We are trying to restore the respect and glory of TV news: Sudhir Chaudhary, Zee News </news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;He&#13;
is a&amp;nbsp;well-known&amp;nbsp;news anchor and heads one of&amp;nbsp;India’s oldest media houses. Sudhir Chaudhary,&amp;nbsp;Editor-in-Chief of Zee News,&amp;nbsp;Wion and&amp;nbsp;DNA,&amp;nbsp;believes that honesty and trust are the two important factors&#13;
that keep a media organisation going. He&amp;nbsp;talks to us about the&#13;
challenges of heading such a big network, the much-talked-about Jindal controversy,&#13;
the allegations of being a pro-government journalist and much more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Edited excerpts:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What according to you are the three factors that work in favour of Zee News? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The most important factor is honesty. All our news reports, including my show, are shown with full honesty. Today, trust is the biggest issue facing journalism. People have lost trust in media. This lack of honesty and trust is the biggest gap in journalism now&amp;nbsp;and we have tried to fill this gap. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Second is the choice of issues. Today, the connect between media and people has diminished. Media has different heroes and people have different heroes. Viewers often tell us that the people media covers are not their heroes and the people they consider heroes are not covered by media. This has increased the gap between viewers and media. We have tried to fill this gap by creating content as per the interest of the viewers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third reason is vibrancy. A channel should be able to convey the message in a better and simple manner, and there are several factors that contribute to this, such as the overall presentation of the news, the look of the studio, the look of the channel, the promptness of the channel etc. We have worked on all these factors. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But at the end of the day, the same technology and infrastructure is available to all channels. So what actually matters is the kind of content that you have, the kind of people who work on that content and the mindset&amp;nbsp;of these people. And so I cannot say that only these three factors have contributed to our success. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the credibility of TV news channels in question today, do you think people would&amp;nbsp;continue to watch news channels?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think people should not stop watching television news. We are trying to do justice to TV news. Our channel is trying to restore the glory and respect of television news. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your channel is accused of showing a lot of news about government. How do you respond to this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is wrong to say that we show a lot of news about government. In fact, we don't show news about government, we show news about India. If you look at the personality of Zee News, you will realise that it is a very positive channel. The problem with media is that its very nature is negative. 99 per cent of the media talks about things that are not happening. They do not talk about things that are happening. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are accused of showing news about government&amp;nbsp;because when we show positive news about the country, people think we are showing positive news about the government, which is not the case. Today the media is divided in such a way that you are seen as either being pro-government or anti-government.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is often said that TRPs can be misleading, what role does TRP play in deciding the content of a channel?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually there are two approaches in which a TRP chart is looked at. A news team can look at the TRP chart of the past three-four weeks and find out what kind of shows are getting higher ratings. For example, if non-news shows are getting higher ratings, the channel increases the number of such shows. Similarly, if debates are garnering higher ratings, then channels show more debates. Which means that the whole programming is being driven by TRP charts and not by your mind or gut feeling or your viewers’ response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other approach, that we at Zee News follow, is that we look at the TRP chart and that’s it. We don't discuss it. We believe that if we create good content, TRP will follow. Rating should always be a by-product. If you give good content, people will watch it, and if people are watching your content, then you will automatically get good ratings. We don’t believe in doing anything just&amp;nbsp;because it will bring TRP. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that of late there has been a polarisation of media? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, unfortunately, the media in the country has been polarised in the past four-five years. It has been divided into two factions on the basis of party line and ideology. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as Zee is concerned, all our channels are pro-Indian. Our Chairman Subhash Chandra, who is also our Editorial Director, has given us very clear instructions that we should show whatever is good for the country and the people of the country. And this is what I do. But today, the situation in the country is such that if you are somebody who is pro-India, you are called a right-wing supporter. And if you say things like ‘there is a sense of insecurity in the country’, you are termed secular and intellectual.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about the recent removal of three senior journalists from a channel?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Three journalists were asked to leave a channel and the whole country is talking about it. In the last five years, nearly 1,000 people working in different media organisations have lost their job and nobody ever talked about it. The channels that are today talking in favour of these three journalists have themselves sacked so many journalists in the past. The removal of these three journalists is&amp;nbsp;being linked to the country. It is being portrayed that had&amp;nbsp;they stayed on, they would have changed the country. But the fact is that these three people have been in the media for the past 20 years, I want to know what have they done so far.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naveen Jindal has withdrawn the bribery case against Zee and you. Your reaction?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I feel happy that I have finally got justice after six long years. And I feel lucky that it happened in just six years because our legal system is such that sometimes people don’t get justice even after 60 years. But I also&amp;nbsp;feel sad that all kinds of false accusations were made against me and I had to face a lot of insult all these years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming to you, heading Zee Media must be quite demanding, so how do you take&amp;nbsp;time out&amp;nbsp;for your show? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Its all driven by passion. I work very passionately. In the beginning, the duration of my show&amp;nbsp;(DNA) was one hour, but then it&amp;nbsp;was increased to one and a half hours. When we decided to start this show, we travelled&amp;nbsp;across the country&amp;nbsp;and met people to find out what they actually want. People told us that they were tired of ‘breaking news’, fake heroes and debates on news channels. I came back and analysed all that people told us and decided not to include those things in my show. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, can we expect a&amp;nbsp;Padma award for you next year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Before 2014, many journalists, doctors and advocates closed to the then Prime Ministers and ministers were given Padma awards. Most of the awardees were selected from Delhi.&amp;nbsp;Even for journalists, winning a Padma award was the biggest achievement of their life. But I think that the biggest award for a journalist is the love and respect of the people. If the people of the country do not love and recognise you, what is the point of having a Padma award?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Translation credit: Shruti Supriya&lt;/em&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Venkatesh Prasad and Aamer Sohail reunite over a cup of tea</news:title>
      <news:description>The India vs. Pakistan match in 1996, a knockout clash, had all the makings of a classic. Pakistan opener Aamer Sohail had hammered Venkatesh Prasad for four to the square boundary and brashly signaled the bowler to fetch the ball. The Indian paceman just turned his back and prepared to send down the next ball. He got in a leg-cutter, and Sohail went for a big heave but completely missed the line. The ball crashed into the off stump. It was Prasad's turn to promptly show him the way to the pavilion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the endeavour facilitated by Mindshare, India’s largest full-service media agency, a part of Group M, the two legends were back to bond after 22 years, and melt their differences over a cup of Brooke Bond Red Label tea, which was broadcast live on Star Sports on 19th of September 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brooke Bond Red Label has always stood for breaking barriers over a cup of tea and making the world a more welcoming place,&amp;nbsp;this time, in association with Star Sports the brand initiated the epic reunion of two cricketing stalwarts who once gave us the real taste of cricket’s greatest rivalry over a cup of tea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537774538_VMuyPg_VP_AS2.jpg" style="width:443px;height:295px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The idea of getting the two stalwarts from the two most rivalrous cricketing nations of the world to sit down relive and probably share a laugh over a cup of tea made for a great initiative for Red Label tea, a brand that has always stood for breaking barriers” said Premjeet Sodhi, Senior Vice President Mindshare Fulcrum, South Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ajay Mehta, Vice President, Mindshare Fulcrum Content+, “No one has seen Aamer Sohail and Venkatesh Prasad together after that electrifying match of 1996. To get them back after 22 years and that too in a live match between India and Pakistan, reliving the moment, this time over a different cup is sweet… isn’t it?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of the association Shiva Krishnamurthy, Vice President, Tea &amp;amp; Foods, Hindustan Unilever says “Brooke Bond Red Label's purpose is to help people find common ground over a cup of tea. The India-Pakistan Asia Cup match is the perfect occasion for Venkatesh Prasad and Aamer Sohail to come together over a tasty cup of Brooke Bond Red Label and chat about their epic exchange at the 1996 World Cup Quarter Final.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the video:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>WhatsApp appoints grievance officer for India</news:title>
      <news:description>Following several controversies, Whatsapp has appointed a grievance officer for India and detailed out the process for users to address concerns and complaints, including those around fake news, say reports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Facebook-owned company has updated its website to reflect the appointment of a 'Grievance Officer for India', which mentions that users can seek help through the mobile app, send an email or write in to 'Komal Lahiri', who is based in the US. Reports say that the appointment was made in August.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;WhatsApp website says users can reach out to the company's support team directly from the app under 'Settings' tab and in case they wish to escalate the complaint, they can contact the Grievance Officer directly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just last month, WhatsApp CEO Chris Daniels had visited India where he met IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad to address issues that the instant messaging company has been facing here, including spread of fake news, accusations of mob lynching, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The latest appointment assumes significance as just last month the Supreme Court had agreed to examine a petition alleging that WhatsApp does not comply with Indian laws, including the provision for appointing a grievance officer. The Apex court had sought a reply on the matter within four weeks.</news:description>

After all, investments are not for the future, they are for now."</news:description>

      <news:title>WATCH: Content marketing strategy is critical to success: Sujit Ganguli, ICICI Bank</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;em&gt;An Initiative by Bloomberg Quint&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Content marketing affords brands the benefit of using clutter-breaking communication to reach out to their target audience. Good content makes a brand stand out in a sea of ‘me too’ brands that are offering similar products and services. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sujit Ganguli, Head - Brand and Corporate Communications at ICICI Bank, says that he uses humour in a serious category like BFSI to make the content more shareable and reach as many people as possible. He shared his insights on content marketing with exchang4media, noting that a content strategy is critical to brands in the current ecosystem. Edited Excerpts: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do advertisers need a specific content marketing strategy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is absolutely critical to have a content marketing strategy to succeed now. People want interesting content; our ads are competing with the superb content being dished out on media today. If we do not have a content marketing strategy, we will only be spending a lot of money and it will not give us ROI. Content that goes viral can generate more ROI than what we can otherwise get. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the key aspects of a good content marketing strategy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The basic principles of marketing have not changed in the last two decades. We have to understand who we are reaching out to, and the insight to produce a creative that is clutter breaking. For example, in our case, we try and use humour in the communication for a serious category like BFSI to break through the clutter. We use humour to get shareability because that is what gets content viral in today’s world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has branded content evolved over the years?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;First change is that the attention span of the viewer has reduced over the years - we no more have the luxury of producing a 60 second TVC and running that on digital; it will not work. Secondly, the scope of content marketing has increased. For years we used to do content marketing and activations in various places but only those who saw the activity would get to know about it. Now I can do a relevant activation for my brand and its proposition and it can go viral on social media and millions can get to know about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Video:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:description>Liberty, the Indian footwear brand, is currently&amp;nbsp;on an expansion mode&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;plans to open 100 new stores in the ongoing&amp;nbsp;fiscal year. Anupam Bansal,&amp;nbsp;Executive Director - Retail, Liberty shoes, has played a key role in building&amp;nbsp;and creating Liberty’s image from being a&amp;nbsp;family footwear to a lifestyle brand. Bansal has been responsible for spearheading and creating a strong retail team for Liberty Shoes.

Which  markets will&amp;nbsp;Liberty will be focusing on&amp;nbsp;the most?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the current fiscal year, we are planning to open around 100 stores. Each year we have been systematically setting annual sales targets. These have been further divided in terms of product development&amp;nbsp;needs and retail expansion needs. The bifurcation is then seen in terms of the long-term perspectives of markets that need development, the ones that need consolidation, and then a future course of action is set. In the next few years, we see our brand interfacing with a much larger group of customers spread across tier 2 cities and we will add about 100 new stores to deliver consumer delight. At present, we have around 400 stores, out of which 150 are company-owned and remaining&amp;nbsp;are franchise stores.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your marketing budget for this year and how much of it&amp;nbsp;goes into digital marketing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the current fiscal year our budget for digital marketing is 10% of the entire budget. The high ROI model of stores helped us expand rapidly and nearly all of them are profitable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How far&amp;nbsp;do you see celebrity endorsements as a beneficial marketing tool for Liberty?&amp;nbsp;Why has&amp;nbsp;the brand has not roped in any celebrity after Hrithik Roshan?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the current growth phase that Liberty is, there are some strategic steps that are being taken for facilitating the long-term goals. Celebrity endorsements are helpful but not so much in the scheme of our strategy currently. People are looking to purchase&amp;nbsp;more shoes, the market is growing and that’s what keeps the brand alive. It’s definitely challenging because the consumer has started to become more demanding, it keeps us on our&amp;nbsp;toes and always motivates us to innovate even more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any particular reason why&amp;nbsp;Liberty has not been very active in the advertising space lately?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our advertising plans are set for the coming months, as are&amp;nbsp;our digital initiatives. We are also coming out with a&amp;nbsp;big campaign ‘Chal Badh Chal’, which will hit the Indian market soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being&amp;nbsp;such an old brand how do you make sure to win the trust&amp;nbsp;of consumers&amp;nbsp;despite&amp;nbsp;growing presence of competing brands in the market?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each brand that comes into the market offers a certain distinctive proposition. We have an undisputed platform of comfort, which our footwear is known for. With some new products that we have introduced, we see the fashion quotient also increasing with our brand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your revenue mix?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company’s current annual revenue stands at about Rs 600&amp;nbsp;crore and it aims to take it to Rs 1,000&amp;nbsp;crore by 2020. The USP of this business is its fast payback and the quick break-even point.&lt;br&gt;At some key markets, where the rentals are very high, franchise options do not really work out. There are only COCO stores, which work out in favour, but for the remote and developing markets where&amp;nbsp;capex is limited and ROI is better,&amp;nbsp;we definitely&amp;nbsp;opt for the franchise route for our&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How seriously is&amp;nbsp;the company is exploring the&amp;nbsp;e-commerce space and what percentage of&amp;nbsp;your&amp;nbsp;sales comes from online?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our online sales are very encouraging. We have been able to cater to a&amp;nbsp;youthful and fashion conscious customer base online. We tracks our repeat purchases, which leads to encouraging results. Our marketing team aggressively runs online marketing campaigns that have yielded good results.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see the growth trajectory of the&amp;nbsp;Indian footwear market two years from now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We see a lot of churn&amp;nbsp;happening in the footwear space. These are being affected by governmental policies as they are pro-industry and make&amp;nbsp;it a business worth investing in. As a popular industry for job creation, it has been getting due focus of the policy makers. Even the retailing investment policies will help upgrade the industry standards in the coming years.</news:description>

      <news:title>We are investing in programmatic advertising to drive revenue growth: Director, Amar Ujala</news:title>
      <news:description>With the rising trend of online content consumption in the country, much of digital India today is being driven by the fast growing multilingual Internet user base. Along with rapid penetration of smartphones, video consumption in regional languages has turned out to be a fast-expanding market. Speaking on these lines, in an interview to exchange4media, Probal Ghosal, Director, Amar Ujala Publications Ltd narrated how their online brand focusing more on videos was implementing technology driven measures in their content in order to overcome the challenge of customising content according to the changing needs of the audience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also mentioned how the brand was adopting programmatic advertising format that is now shaping the future of digital marketing and online advertising. Ghosal mentioned the brand was looking at boosting the website’s monetisation and further generate faster revenue growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited Excerpts: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take us through your core brand values that justify the credibility behind the sole brand name. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amar Ujala stands for credibility, honesty, integrity and neutrality. Amar Ujala.com, which is an extension of Amar Ujala paper provides its readers with content they can trust. The creative content that we deliver comes with a promise for our readers such that others also rely on us in their quest for authentic content. Fake news being an existential crisis in social media, it is necessary for publishers like us to create brand trust in order to win customer loyalty. We look forward to changing the paradigm where readership isn’t bought by sensationalising news anymore. While we continue to work on placing few editorial checks and balances into practice, we are focused on delivering our promise to the readers be it on website or mobile-app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the differentiating factors that help Amar Ujala stand out from its competitors?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our attention is on news sustainability while delivering content to the readers. Creating a convergence story and innovating our interaction are two important factors that differentiate us from our competitors. Our stories in the print domain are covered widely on our website and video section as well for today’s digital savvy audience. Through this editorial convergence our aim is to provide our consumers with more content giving them multiple perspectives on a particular story through all mediums online, video and print.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, we are also focusing on innovating our engagement with consumers by implementing technology driven measures in our content. Through this we aim to connect the interactivity of our newspaper with digital. The QR code feature in our big stories on print, once scanned leads the user to our website giving him an experience of both reading and visualising the story through online video at the same time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Engaging with the audience in the right manner is of utmost importance to us. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The target audience for Amar Ujala app is majorly established out of tier-2 and tier-3 cities. What are some of the challenges when it comes to digital marketing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, video content has been found to be more engaging and attractive compared to any other medium. 500 million users today are vernacular users compared to that of 150 million users of English on digital. With video consumption in regional languages being higher in tier 2-3 cities, it provides us with more opportunities in the video business. Also, with the growing mobile market, online video content consumption is growing by the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mind set of users in tier-2 and tier-3 cities is very different from those living in urban areas. The challenge here is to customise the content as per the habits of our readers. Amar Ujala.com’s interactive television feature helps us engage efficiently with our consumers.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;We have come up with a feature called ‘City app’ which helps our users stay updated and informed about news as per the city they are located in. As of now, the feature is limited to our footprint serving seven locations and the districts around them. While we are looking at broadening our target market, currently the app is functional in cities including Agra, Kanpur, Varanasi, Lucknow, Allahabad, and Chandigarh. The app supports users to customise their news feed as per the information breaking in that particular city. Besides this, it also provides utility based information such as whereabouts of restaurants, movie halls, medical emergency, blood banks etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Amar Ujala.com’s content marketing strategy? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our content marketing is primarily based on two business models. One wherein we create small videos covering different genres be it comedy, entertainment, lifestyle, news, etc. in order to engage with our users. Second, we believe in a user’s collaborative business model, wherein consumers take part in creating video content and thereby drive content through our platform. For example, the launch of Amar Ujala Kavya.com has put together video content in poetry across cultures with the participation of several poets in India. At times, we also invite few selective poets to our studio in order to conduct an interactive session, which is then aired on our website. Users can both engage and participate through this medium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will features like audio, localisation and Khush Khabar segment help attract more consumers versus the outreach your competitors have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We believe that content should speak. The audio feature is quite similar to a moving radio. This audio feature supports users in having the article read out aloud instead of having to read it all by themselves. One can avail the audio option while driving, cooking or making transactions online.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the ‘Khush Khabar’ section, our positioning here is to bring good news to our readers, thereby creating a happy environment around them while crime rates are soaring high in cities. Stories and videos in this segment can be in the form of a feature idea, a news piece or lifestyle content that unfurls good vibes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What percentage of Amar Ujala's ad spend is on digital? Name some significant digital spend that has contributed in leveraging the brand's efficiency and has maximised its reach.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our digital ad spend is growing exponentially, therefore making the website Amar Ujala.com a profit making business. However, it’s time to spend more on technology, new resources, upcoming platforms, engage more in video to be able to cater to the growing interests of our readers. As digital is here to create a difference, the integration of online with our print brand will help us maximise our reach and opportunity, both. We are looking at creating a common audience piece where in consumers can refer to our paper and website both at the same time for more content. Therefore, through our digital presence we aim to make use of metrics and apply cross-media audience measurement measures to evaluate our combined audience viewership. This will further leverage our engagement with brands, advertisers and agencies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of your key digital strategies for the next five&amp;nbsp;years?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The road map is clear for us. Amar Ujala.com is primarily looking to grow on video, editorial convergence, interactive TV and by localising content. With our focus for the next few years being on revenue maximisation, we are efficiently investing in programmatic advertising, which is certainly the need of the hour. As we connect with brands on digital, it’s crucial for them to be aware of our target audience and the brand positioning of Amar Ujala.com in respective areas. Therefore, with a guaranteed opportunity through programmatic, publishers and brands consuming ads, going ahead we will be able to see more value in our brand name. With such key digital strategies not only will we be able to boost our website monetisation but also drive faster revenue growth for our online brand.</news:description>

      <news:title>How Twitter enabled Zee TV to refresh its brand identity with #AajLikhengeKal &#13;
&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;In October last year as Zee TV embarked on a&amp;nbsp;journey to mark its&amp;nbsp;its 25th&amp;nbsp;year, the brand leveraged Twitter&amp;nbsp;to unveil its&#13;
refreshed brand promise – Aaj Likhenge Kal, a philosophy brought alive with a&amp;nbsp;new&#13;
visual identity to signify the aspirations of the great Indian middle class. The&#13;
objective behind the launch of this campaign by&amp;nbsp;using Twitter was to create&#13;
conversations and&amp;nbsp;a strong brand association around the&amp;nbsp;idea #AajLikhengeKal&#13;
in an innovative manner.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter&#13;
today is a go-to platform for brands to communicate with consumers and&amp;nbsp;thereby increase brand exposure.&amp;nbsp;With over 1 billion registered users, its fast paced feed and&amp;nbsp;real time conversations makes every brand effectively leverage its 280-character limit into online marketing gold.   In order to drive maximum impact on its new&#13;
ideology, Zee TV went for Twitter, where in they disclosed their brand film in conjunction&#13;
with the launch on TV by using First View, a 24-hour takeover of the prime real&#13;
estate property on Twitter. On Twitter, the brand idea was established through a&#13;
promoted trend along with an evocative description.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Presenting our brand anthem composed by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VishalBhardwaj?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@VishalBhardwaj&lt;/a&gt; and sung by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shreyaghoshal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@shreyaghoshal&lt;/a&gt; that brings alive &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AajLikhengeKal?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AajLikhengeKal&lt;/a&gt; beautifully. &lt;a href="https://t.co/fd2sfucDg8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fd2sfucDg8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zee TV (@ZeeTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZeeTV/status/919597999013076992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 15, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;
&lt;!-- ELRTE_SCRIPT:script2297869791934155 --&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;In&#13;
the build up to Zee TV’s Refresh Brand campaign that lasted for a week from October&#13;
16 to October 23, 2017, the brand leveraged a ‘Like or Retweet to&#13;
remind’ campaign on Twitter. Through this, every user who re-tweeted the tweet&#13;
from Zee TV on&amp;nbsp;witnessing the unveil was returned a Tweet with the brand anthem sung by Shreya Ghosal. Also, in&#13;
the second&amp;nbsp;phase of engagement, the users received a&#13;
second auto reply showcasing a powerful film from the brand called ‘India&#13;
Rising’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A retired government employee took a flight for the first time in his life. The reason will melt your heart. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AajLikhengeKal?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AajLikhengeKal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Y8otzGykaX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Y8otzGykaX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zee TV (@ZeeTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZeeTV/status/919597487937044482?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 15, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#13;
&lt;!-- ELRTE_SCRIPT:script5293028617359257 --&gt;&#13;
&lt;p class="normal" style="" text-align:justify"=""&gt;Prathyusha&#13;
Agarwal, CMO, ZEEL, had said, “Zee TV has enriched the life of millions of viewers across&#13;
the world by bringing alive content that mirrored the common man's life and&#13;
dreams. In its 25th year, the channel embarked on crafting the vision for its journey&#13;
ahead by unveiling its new brand promise – Aaj Likhenge Kal that aimed to&#13;
ignite a spark amongst viewers to take charge of their destinies and curate an&#13;
extraordinary future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;"We&#13;
used Twitter as a platform to not only unveil our new brand promise and channel&#13;
visual identity but also engage and converse with viewers through an innovative&#13;
two-way engagement mechanism. The partnership not only entailed effective reach&#13;
but our simplistic and minimalistic messaging approach made the brand promise a&#13;
part of viewers’ lives.”&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;With&#13;
this launch, Twitter and&amp;nbsp;Zee TV&amp;nbsp;set best practices for a Twitter&#13;
enabled Refresh Brand campaign. The video tweet with the brand film was a&#13;
complete win last year receiving&amp;nbsp;350,000 video views during the campaign&#13;
flight period of four&amp;nbsp;days back then. With Twitter known to drive relevant&#13;
conversations on its platform, Zee TV focused on building conversations&#13;
receiving almost 30,000 auto replies around the key word #AajLikhengeKal. This&#13;
later became one of the most mentioned hashtags receiving&amp;nbsp;43K mentions&#13;
during the campaign period last year. Leveraging Twitter’s unique custom&#13;
solutions, Zee TV even rewarded users for their engagement with customised&#13;
content which helped create additional&amp;nbsp;positive vibe for&amp;nbsp;the campaign. Along&#13;
with this, it also allowed users to benefit from&#13;
engaging with Zee TV’s tweet&amp;nbsp;by providing them with relevant content from a&amp;nbsp;media channel of their interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537758626_zzHryq_zeetweet1.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Watch: Branded content and native advertising go hand in hand: Gurmit Singh, Yahoo India&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;em&gt;An Initiative by Bloomberg Quint &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main purpose of content marketing is to increase the engagement with the consumer. Hence, the metrics like time spent is the key performance indicator for a good content marketing campaign. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gurmit Singh, Former VP &amp;amp; MD, Yahoo India, in a conversation with exchange4media, shares his thoughts on content marketing campaigns, and why native advertising and branded content go hand in hand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpts: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What according to you are the key performance indicators for content marketing campaign?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to me, the main purpose of content marketing is increasing engagement. Therefore engagement metrics like time spent, how much people read in terms of viewing time etc. is the most important metrics for the branded content. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content marketing can help reduce your overall marketing costs. Do you agree?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I completely agree that content marketing helps reduce overall cost because it is much more engaging than advertising, therefore, the ROI is much better. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Native advertising and how brands capitalise on it?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Native advertising means the marketing rest within the content so native advertising can be used to drive native content. More and more users can be driven through native advertising and it can happen through various platforms and need not be the platform on which branded content exist. So branded content and native advertising go hand in hand and can enhance each others value. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is traditional content marketing being left out in the digital push?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the contrary, I think brand marketing is where digital started off but as we go along more and more creative formats in content marketing are evolving. Especially on digital, we see a lot of players now coming into that and space is getting more exciting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nTlFWdXZIg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>How OTT and e-commerce platforms are challenging Google-Facebook duopoly</news:title>
      <news:description>The Google-Facebook duopoly is being challenged. E-commerce sites and OTT platforms are eyeing a slice of the ad pie and slowly but steadily eating into the monies that traditionally went to Google and Facebook. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the US alone, advertisers are expected to spend $4.61 billion on Amazon in 2018, accounting for 4.1% of all digital ad spending in the country. A study by eMarketer  expects the spend on Amazon to double this year. In Q2 of 2018, Amazon generated $2.19 billion in ad revenue. The&amp;nbsp;study expects “increases of more than 50% per year through at least 2020, when Amazon will enjoy 7.0% of all US digital ad spending.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In India, ad-supported Over-The-Top platforms such as Hotstar, SonyLiv, and VOOT etc are quickly gaining ground as reliable alternatives to Google and Facebook. According to a recently launched KPMG Report titled ‘Media Ecosystems: The Walls Fall Down’, nearly 15% of the digital ad monies can be attributed to the ad revenues of OTT platforms. The report estimates the size of the digital advertising market to reach Rs 11,600 crore in FY 2018 and the OTT platforms are expected to earn Rs 1,720 crore from advertising alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OTTs the big draw &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;YouTube is the leading video streaming site in India with 245 million monthly active users (MAUs). It is a highly favoured destination for advertisers. After YouTube, Hotstar is emerging as the undisputed second when it comes to video streaming in India. Hotstar has 150 million MAUs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Streaming sites like Hotstar and Sony Liv that broadcast sports events see massive traffic during matches. During the IPL 2018, a total of 202 million viewers logged into Hotstar to watch matches. The final match alone had a record number of 10.3 million viewers logging in. Around 70 million users watched the FIFA World Cup on Sony Liv. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital media buyers say that on a normal day, Hotstar’s masthead&amp;nbsp;is priced at Rs 15-20 lakh per day. It is important to note that OTT platforms make hay during matches. Like with SonyLiv during FIFA and Hotstar during IPL and&amp;nbsp;Asia Cup. According to sources, ad rates on Hotstar for key matches range between Rs 30 lakh and Rs 1 crore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abhishek Desai - Director - Marketing Operations, India, P&amp;amp;G, said that for his brands, the most obvious choices after Google and Facebook are OTT platforms like Hotstar and VOOT and e-commerce sites such as Amazon. He said that he chooses to spend on e-commerce from a sales perspective and prefers OTT platforms because they are not as walled as Google and Facebook and are brand-safe as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hotstar has increased its ad rates following the successful performance during IPL, say media buyers. “I have noticed that some inventory on Hotstar is as much as 1.2 times more expensive than YouTube,” said a digital media buyer who did not wish to be named. Hotstar has emerged as a brand-safe platform that offers curated video content alongside which brands can advertise. “This allows Hotstar the bargaining power to claim a premium for its video ad inventory,” said Gopa Kumar, EVP, Isobar India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital media buyers say that the money being spent on OTT platforms is directly coming out of the money that used to be set aside for Google/Facebook. OTTs have become a marketer’s prime choice after YouTube in particular because the platforms support video ads. Delivering the Subhash Ghoshal Memorial Lecture, Rajan Anandan, VP South East Asia, and India, Google, said that India is turning out to be a video-first Internet market. He said that by 2020, 500 million of the 650 million Internet&amp;nbsp;users from India will consume&amp;nbsp;video content. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The e-commerce story&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;E-commerce in India is still a relatively small part of the overall retail market, accounting for just over 2% of the retail market. Yet, it is a very viable and sought-after place to advertise for products that are bought online. A study by Isobar India shows that fashion apparel, electronic goods and beauty products are the three most popular categories bought online. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rahul Vengalil, CEO, WhatClicks, said that advertising on e-commerce sites directly impacts sales while ads on OTT platforms serve the purpose of creating awareness about a brand. Shrenik Gandhi, co-founder and CEO, White Rivers Media, said he has noticed consumer-facing brands that are present on marketplaces prefer Amazon as a platform to advertise after the behemoths of Google and Facebook. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital marketers say it is hard to measure how much money is flowing into the e-commerce platforms from brands because the spend most likely comes from the sales team’s budgets and not necessarily the marketing team’s budgets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The killer combo &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is when e-commerce and OTT platforms work together that they can truly challenge Facebook and Google. To that end, Flipkart and Hotstar have tied up to share data and serve ads on Hotstar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explaining the basis of this partnership, Prakash Sikaria, Senior Director, Flipkart said, “As we scale up, we have been trying to figure out how to show relevant ads to customers when they are on the platform and off the platform. The endeavour is to make the shopping journey shorter.” He said that Flipkart does not have video ad inventory and the tie-up with Hotstar gives Flipkart the opportunity to “move from a static conversation to a more engaging video conversation.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Media buyers have applauded this strategic partnership, calling it a masterstroke. “Marrying viewing habits with shopping content helps understand the consumer so much better,” said Shamsuddin Jasani, Group MD for South Asia, Isobar. He said that more such collaborations where partners share data to better understand a consumer’s journey and influence the consumer at the right time are needed for the industry.</news:description>

      <news:title>SBI Life's new campaign targets millennials to take insurance as a happy responsibility</news:title>
      <news:description>SBI Life Insurance, one of the leading private life insurance companies in India, launched its ‘Main se Hum’ campaign today, establishing a sharp focus on the company’s portfolio of protection products. The 360° campaign targets millennials across multiple platforms including TV, print, outdoor, along with digital and social media.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Contrary to popular belief millennials are happy to take on responsibilities of safeguarding their loved ones, as they progress in life. The campaign positions insurance as a happy responsibility to help millennials progress through various life stages, subtly appealing to the cohort’s instinct of protecting themselves and their loved ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The protective instinct that one acquires with the transition of ‘Main se hum’ is cleverly conceptualised and captured by Mullen Lintas in the launch film. Juxtaposing a carefree youth enjoying the thrill of standing close to passing metro train against a mature family man who is extra cautious while boarding a cable car with his wife and kid, subtly showcases the shift from ‘Main se hum’ as one grows in life. Using multiple everyday instances which showcase the transition of a carefree youth to an instinctively protective version of oneself, SBI Life’s ‘Main se hum’ campaign positions insurance as a happy responsibility tool for one’s protection needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ravindra Sharma, SVP &amp;amp; Chief of Brand &amp;amp; Corporate Communications, SBI Life Insurance, said, “Main se Hum celebrates the happy responsibilities that come along as one progresses in life. Layers of research indicate a peculiar trend, that with the progression from ‘Main se hum’, one is instinctively driven to protect their loved ones. Our communication is aimed at driving awareness that insurance is a tool which takes care of one’s protection needs, essentially providing the peace of mind required to take on newer responsibilities in life.” &lt;br&gt;He further added, “There is a clutter of brands pushing campaigns designed around media consumption patterns of the millennial. SBI Life on the other hand is appealing to the behavioural tendencies, which indicate that millennials are happy to take on responsibilities for their loved ones as they progress in life. We believe approaching insurance as a happy responsibility will also assist in widening the insurance penetration in India, over the long run.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the campaign, Amer Jaleel, Chairman at Mullen Lintas, said, “The process of discovering insurance insights has been one of the richest experiences I have had in my career. With SBI Life we dug really deep to uncover the instinct of a protector. And that is that the protective instinct kicks in when you’re thinking changes from the younger ‘main’ thinking’ to the more mature ‘hum’ thinking’ and that is what we have based our work on. Insurance is that ‘main se hum’ ka kadam that we all have to take in life.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fDFryw_z9ZQ" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>FabAlley embraces body positivity with #FabFitsAll campaign</news:title>
      <news:description>Online fashion portal, FabAlley, has introduced a new campaign to champion inclusivity in fashion and embracing body positivity. The digital campaign features fashion influencers proclaiming the bold message of believing in being just fab, irrespective of one’s size, shape, height or weight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One size does not fit all and the fashion industry is missing a nearly $300 billion global opportunity. Coresight Research estimates that the global adaptive clothing market will reach $278.2 billion this year and increase to $325.8 billion in 2022. The plus-size segment is estimated to account for $5-6 billion in the $40-billion Indian online fashion apparel market by 2020, that is, 10-12% of the overall market. Retail came one step closer to serving a significant portion of the Indian inclusive fashion market opportunity this week, when FabAlley announced the launch of their new, size-inclusive campaign called #FabFitsAll. The brand offers clothing in sizes ranging from XS to XL with their regular line, and up to 4XL with their Curve sub-brand. This campaign focuses on the spectrum of sizes that FabAlley brands have to offer, all while ensuring a superb fit across all sizes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this campaign, FabAlley has turned to real life issues and experiences - the ways plus-size or extra-small size clothes are failing the women who wear them. It was noted that the clothes being designed for women in double-digit or extra small sizes do not have the level of design or quality of regular sizes. Inclusion is more than just selling clothes in larger or smaller sizes. It’s about offering the same quality clothing to these shoppers in an array of styles and price points, as being offered to their regular-sized counterparts. FabAlley aims to bring attention to style, trend, fit and fabric, all at the same time and emerge as an on-trend label with a fashion-girl aesthetic, which is size agnostic. The brand’s objective is to ensure that the garments not only flatter a variety of body types, but also seamlessly transition time, lifestyle and seasons.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;FabAlley has been built on the tenets of Diversity, Relatability and Inclusiveness, which lie at the heart of the brand. Keeping all this in mind #FabFitsAll celebrates diversity in fashion, encouraging the modern day girl to make bold and Fab choices. It is aimed at empowering real woman and inspiring a new generation of girls uninterrupted to be themselves, realize their dreams and dress however they please. The campaign aims to unshackle conventional societal mindsets, breaking down barriers and challenging fashion stereotypes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In their campaign #FabFitsAll, the brand has partnered with five diverse influencers - Spardha Malik, Sakshi Sindwani, Monalisha Mahapatra, Sonam Kanotra and Prachi Kapoor who are proclaiming the brand’s DNA, loud and proud. The campaign propagates and amplifies the message of dressing however one pleases to, regardless of their size, shape, height or weight. The brand believes #FabFitsAll is not just a campaign but a culture that embraces becoming your best self without adhering to what society has deemed as acceptable and 'normal'. The digital video reiterates ‘all women are beautiful in their own way’. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the campaign, Tanvi Malik and Shivani Poddar, Co-Founders, FabAlley said, “We want to empower women to embrace and love their natural selves. As a brand we want to encourage all women to throw away inhibitions. With #FabFitsAll, FabAlley is propagating body positivity strongly.  Words like fit and fat do not belong in our lingo, we believe in just being Fab – Fab at any size, weight or shape.” They added, “ Inclusivity is our brand’s DNA &amp;amp; our fabulous tribe of diverse fashion influencers is proclaiming it, loud and proud. Women have always been under tremendous pressure to conform to sizeist norms. #FabFitsAll is our plea to women, who break down a little every day because they feel they don’t fit the “ideal” mould to throw the ought to be’s, should be’s, if only’s and when I’s out the window, because they are fab just the way they are.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign will go live on FabAlley’s social media channels and on their website.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ivVk_U-sPw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Katrina Kaif to endorse Lino Perros brand</news:title>
      <news:description>Lino Perros, the accessories and handbags brand, unveiled its new campaign featuring Katrina Kaif. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ambition is to position Lino Perros as a brand for culturally curious women. Touching upon the new campaign, Sanjay Dua, Managing Director, said, "Our brand is known for its designs. This new collection resonates with Katrina’s personal style: chic, elegant, and sophisticated. Today handbags are becoming a symbol of stature.  I have no doubt about the fact that no one can match up to Katrina’s charisma and personal style as a brand ambassador.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A top actress or star creates a reflection of the consumer’s self-image. Brands draw this energy to reach out to a wider audience,” Dua added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the association, brand ambassador Katrina Kaif said, “I am delighted to be associated with Lino Perros, as they have consistently focused on providing the products that have a cut above the rest and there are no compromises made when it comes to refinement and extravagance. The brand association with Lino Perros is unique. What attracts me the most to the brand is the style and the colors that help target all the millennials. I am truly excited and look forward towards a more extensive association with Lino Perros.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brand has planned a 360-degree marketing approach across print, radio, social media and a 45 second TVC. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credits:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creative conceptualisation:&amp;nbsp;Natasha &amp;amp; Sanjay Dua, Poonam Adhikari&lt;br&gt;Production House -Passion film India&lt;br&gt;Director - Karan Kapadia</news:description>

      <news:title>The Hindu Lounge launches its flagship e-store, The Hindu Lounge Online</news:title>
      <news:description>The Hindu Lounge, India’s first experience store from a publishing house, has launched a first-of-its-kind online store that brings back to life glorious moments that have shaped our world, in a new and exciting avatar – The Hindu Lounge Online. In response to the overwhelming success of the physical store at the Express Avenue Mall in Chennai, this portal is launched as the Group commemorates its 140 years in journalism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;Loyalist readers claim this is the one newspaper they must read every day. In an attempt to engage with audiences beyond the print newspaper, we are launching an online shopping portal at &lt;a href="https://lounge.thehindu.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://lounge.thehindu.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a varied range of collectibles available to buy, the store is broadly classified into four categories – The Madras Edition, Personalised Collection, Restored Collection and Handmade Collection. Madras Edition deals with products of nostalgia and quirk authentic to the City from coffee mugs, photo frames, coasters and more. Restored Collection is a one-stop-shop for all things upcycled, made from old editions of our own newspaper and magazine – there’s baskets, pen holders, coasters, tea sets and much more. Handmade Collection is the very representation of style and class – khadi journals, handmade paper, envelopes, gift tags, brass metal bookmarks and more have been beautifully crafted in collaboration with Anand Prakash. We will be expanding shortly to other city and thematic collections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The store’s highlight is the Personalised Collection – a framed front page reprint of The Hindu, be it a significant news milestone (such as the news of Independent India or Team India’s 1983 World Cup win) or personal landmark (birthday or anniversary or any special occasion).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On this occasion, Selva Prabu, Brand Manager, The Hindu Group, said, “Encouraged by the response at our physical store, we are excited to launch an online store to service readers beyond Chennai. The city collection evokes an emotional connect with customers and the personalised collection of framed front page reprint has been a big hit for gifts on birthdays and retirements. We are constantly gathering feedback and ideas for new collections, in fact, many of the restored and handmade products are based on ideas from walk-in customers at our store”.</news:description>

      <news:title>Gaurav Lulla of Viacom18 quits to start new content studio </news:title>
      <news:description>After having quit Viacom18, Gaurav Lulla, who was head of digital media for MTV India and English Cluster including Vh1, Comedy Central and Colors Infinity, is starting a new content studio named Loose Cannons, a boutique content studio that specialises in content creation for Media hubs and brands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lulla says, “The current content eco-system is at a tipping point. With the massive influx of content pipes, over and above the traditional ones that existed, the content creation eco-system has changed dramatically. This has led to two very diverse challenges : A) Content Pipes need to collaborate with varied creators to bring engaging stories to their platforms B) Current form of advertising needs to alter to reach out to consumers in unique formats applicable to each content consumption touchpoint. To address this alteration, the eco-system needs an almost disruptive approach by a motley bunch of Loose Cannons who keep firing and experimenting with varied content initiatives. Pavneet and I identified with this at a very personal level and hence “Loose Cannons Content Studio”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Loose Cannons Content Studio operates in two diverse universes. On one hand, we partner with varied media houses across platforms to enrich their content offering. On the other hand, we aim to solve the imminent communication challenge facing brands to engage audiences beyond awareness scores. The good news is that both of these journeys have the same starting point : A strong story,” adds Lulla.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Co-Founder Pavneet Gakhal explains, “With an aim to establish strategic alliances and collaborations with a bouquet of production houses, talent management outfits and new age technocrats, we aim to create content that enthrals audiences across all screens. We have a catalogue of content IPs across limited fiction series and non-fiction show formats which we are in the process of commissioning.  We will dabble with all kinds of branded content initiatives all the way from conceptualization of the content, producing it to be relevant across platforms of consumption and finally building a content marketing campaign around it to amplify its reach.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lulla had joined Viacom18 in 2011.</news:description>

      <news:title>The Hindu turns 140</news:title>
      <news:description>When a newspaper completes 140 years, it stands as a testament to its greatness. The Hindu is began in 1878 with 80 copies is today nearly 16 lakh in print with almost 60 lakh readership pan India. This journey is a result of its loyal readers and hard-earned trust from both consumers and advertisers that this daily newspaper has amassed over the years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quoting from the first editorial, titled ‘Ourselves’, The Hindu aims to always be guided by the principles of “fairness and justice”.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537509992_fg3BW4_mukundhindu.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mukund Padmanabhan, Editor, The Hindu, said, “As a newspaper, we make a clear distinction between news and opinion. We generally refrain from speculation and attempt to verify what we report. Of course, we do make mistakes, but importantly we acknowledge them and apologise for our errors when required. I think all of this is what has contributed to the trust The Hindu commands with its readers and with the public at large.”&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537509978_dNPb6u_rajivhindu.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rajiv Lochan, CEO, The Hindu, said, “140 years is substantial for any institution. 140 years with an unparalleled reputation and a deep sense of duty is rare. This is a moment for us at The Hindu Group to cherish, and pay tribute to our readers, whose continued support and patronage, allows us to remain India's trusted voice.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To commemorate this occasion, the partner fraternity including agents and vendors, celebrated the brand as part of The Hindu family with cakes and banners and wished the best of luck for the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an attempt to give back to its readers one more time, in the coming year, a series of exciting launches have been lined up. As a first of many is the launch of The Hindu Online Lounge at https://lounge.thehindu.com, one of India’s first experience stores from a publishing house. In response to the success of the physical store at the Express Avenue Mall in Chennai, the online store will now be available to readers across the country. With a varied range of collectibles available to buy, the store is broadly classified into four categories – The Madras Edition, Personalised Collection, Restored Collection and Handmade Collection.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The store’s highlight is the Personalised Collection – a framed front page reprint of The Hindu, be it a significant news milestone (such as the news of Independent India or Team India’s 1983 World Cup win) or personal landmark (birthday or anniversary or any special occasion)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Hindu Group has widened its reach through ‘THEME’ (The Hindu Group Events, Meets &amp;amp; Experiences), the events vertical of the Group that has touched over 1 million people across 15 cities. The launch of ‘Briefcase’, an English news bulletin app that delivers five important and exclusive news stories every morning, also holds a special place on The Hindu calendar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Twitter hashtag #TheHinduat140 trended on September 20 with many readers reminiscing about their connection with the newspaper. &lt;/div&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Role of communications has become wider in brand building: Aman Dhall, Policybazaar</news:title>
      <news:description>Brand building is no longer the forte of marketers alone. Communications professionals have emerged to become an integral part of this process and also its most dependable custodians. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interview with exchange4media, Aman Dhall, Head of Communications, Policybazaar Group of Companies,&amp;nbsp;highlights this critical role played by communications professionals in brand building and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537502593_YhAHOv_IPRCCA-logo_%281%29.jpg" style="width:350px;height:164px;float:right"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Has the role of corporate communications become more complex than before?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The communications domain was earlier looked at from the perspective of public relations, and expectations were only about getting media visibility and reach. This has now completely changed, especially with the coming of social media. Now in the last 10 to 15 years it has gone beyond that expectation and the role has become much wider in terms of brand building. While your brand marketing guys help you in establishing the brand, your communication guys are the ones who actually sustain it throughout. They are the ones who are communicating the positive ethos and ensuring that it is seen as a trustworthy brand with which people would like to be&amp;nbsp;associated with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does brand building work in your category which&amp;nbsp;is still a nascent market in India? How are you making your products more mainstream?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Insurance as a category is more about awareness, when you talk about financial services it's about gaining trust, and if you talk about the consumer internet space, it has to be at a certain speed. They expect things to happen at a certain speed and then only are they&amp;nbsp;going to try your product. You have to look at all these parameters and somewhere communicate the same to your consumers. Through our campaigns we want to empower consumers before buying any insurance products. We have been working to simplify the insurance literature and we are working with the regulator to see how we can make a product simpler for consumers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has the concept of ‘always on’ brand engagement made corporate communications a challenging task?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, earlier we used to get some time to respond to a story, even if it was a negative story, one used to get one’s own sweet time to think through such stories. Now the scenario is very different. Things happen very quickly and adverse online posts can damage your reputation in no time. Now you need to create some benchmark and find a way to respond to the situation, and in today's market environment you cannot keep&amp;nbsp;quiet, unless the silence is strategic. There are many examples of big brands spending millions of dollars just because they could not respond in time to a&amp;nbsp;crisis and resurrect the brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, how do you decide your preferred media platforms when it comes to brand building?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For us TV has been the medium that has created maximum value. With all due respect to other mediums, we have not been able to evaluate how they have helped in our business. We do digital too because we don't want to lose out on when people are searching for insurance products online and our name does not show up there. Similarly we do radio on an experimental&amp;nbsp;basis to build reach, but definitely the wider impact has been generated by television. In television, what we use is the eight minute model to evaluate the impact of the campaign that we do. So when an ad goes live on a certain channel, we can see the traffic in the next 8 minutes that it is directing to our website. This is a metric of gauging effectiveness of any medium and this approach has given us fantastic results.</news:description>

      <news:title>Former COO of FCB Ulka Sanjay Tandon joins Thinkstr as CEO </news:title>
      <news:description>Gurgaon-based independent agency Thinkstr has brought Sanjay Tandon onboard as CEO. Former COO at FCB Ulka Delhi, Tandon was last associated with Indian FMCG giant RSPL as the Consumer Marketing Head for one of its verticals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confirming the appointment, Satbir Singh, Founder of Thinkstr, says, “As we grow and expand, we needed someone who’d bring the much-needed method to the madness. In over two decades, Sanjay has worked across telecom, automotive, e-commerce, FMCG, durables and lifestyle categories. Not only has he run a large agency office, he brings precious experience from the other side, having been a client. That understanding of business dynamics makes Thinkstr’s offering stronger. And to top it all, he’s a friend of nearly two decades."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sanjay Tandon says, “When I met Satbir, it was like continuing from where we left when we worked together professionally in the past. We share a passion for being very consumer-centric, client-focused and doing work that places our brands ahead of the curve in the market. Marketers are today fragmenting their energy and focussing across multiple agencies, suffering cost inefficiency, lack of agility and inadequate senior-level expertise to navigate their brand’s journey in the consumer’s life. At Thinkstr, we are geared to think ahead and deliver marketing programmes with excellence.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thinkstr's clients include NITI Aayog, William Grants’ Glenfiddich, Twinings, Usha International, Soothe Healthcare etc.</news:description>

      <news:title>Digital is mainstream: Rajan Anandan, Google</news:title>
      <news:description>The profile of the internet user is dramatically changing from ‘metro, male, millennial’ to include more women. “By 2020, 45 per cent of all internet users is expected to be women. There has been a 4X growth in rural users since 2012,” said Rajan Anandan, Vice President, Google India and South East Asia, speaking about The New Internet User in Mumbai on Thursday. Anandan was delivering the annual Subhas Ghosal Memorial Lecture on the invitation of the Advertising Agencies Association of India (AAAI) and Subhas Ghosal Foundation (SGF). &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Giving&amp;nbsp;out stats and figures about the changing internet landscape in India as he&amp;nbsp;addressed&amp;nbsp;a room full of advertising veterans, Anandan&amp;nbsp;said that voice, vernacular and video are defining the evolution of internet in India. Anandan noted that of the 390 mn internet users in India, 330 mn (around 80%) access the internet on their mobiles. This number is expected to grow to 500 mn by 2020. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At present, nearly 95 per cent of all video consumption in happening in Indian languages. Anandan pointed out that new Indian users who are coming online for the first time are Indic language users. He said that by 2020, 400mn of the 650mn using&amp;nbsp;Indic languages - 62 per cent users will use the internet in Hindi and other Indian languages. Currently, 200mn of the 390mn Indian internet users are Indic language users. “There has been a 10X growth in local language queries over last 18 months,” Anandan noted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that the trend of using voice on the internet has been a rather&amp;nbsp;surprising development. The industry has seen a 270% growth in voice search and 400% growth in Hindi voice search. He said that new internet users are more comfortable with speaking to the internet, therefore companies need to start thinking about building products with a voice-first approach. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a time when ad spends on digital are growing at 30%  CAGR, television is still the mass reach medium for advertisers. He said that with YouTube’s 245 mn MAUs (monthly active users) the reach of the video streaming site far exceeds the reach of any TV channel. “Digital is mainstream in India,” he announced as he gave out&amp;nbsp;more numbers.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The digital explosion has surely made life more convenient, be that ordering food home, or booking a taxi, and why even getting groceries delivered home, but digital can do a lot more than that, Anandan pointed out. He said that Indians in rural India who spend nearly 35-40 per cent of their income on medical expenses are the ones that need the internet more than the urban/metro folk. With more connected users coming online, Indian entrepreneurs need to be solving real problems of real India. He cited the examples of start-ups&amp;nbsp;Niramai, Sig-Tuple which are revolutionising the medical diagnostics space in India. “As the new internet users comes online and get&amp;nbsp;connected, we are going to start seeing some incredible things that you can do to solve their real needs,” he concluded.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While it was an evening of new&amp;nbsp;learnings&amp;nbsp;from Anandan, it was also an evening to remember and celebrate the great doyen of advertising - Subhas Ghosal. This year Ivan Arthur,&amp;nbsp;who was groomed by Ghosal,&amp;nbsp; went down memory lane as a tribute to&amp;nbsp;his mentor. Arthur delivered a poetic remembrance that gave the audience, who had not had the good fortune of knowing Ghosal, a little taste of what it was like to work with and learn from the&amp;nbsp;legend. Arthur brought Ghosal alive, even if for just a few minutes, and inspired the room to aim higher and seek perfection.</news:description>

      <news:title>Johnnie Walker-The Journey's first India campaign celebrates Mission Mars</news:title>
      <news:description>Johnnie Walker – The Journey is celebrating India’s one of most powerful progress stories&amp;nbsp;with a movie by actor-turned-director Imran Khan-- Mission Mars: Keep Walking India. Released on YouTube on September 19, the short film is Johnnie Walker – The Journey’s first India campaign. It has garnered 215k views with 312 comments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the film, Abhishek Shahabadi, Vice President- Marketing at Diageo India, says the story exemplifies the optimism and creativity that keeps us walking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Johnnie Walker –The Journey’s first India campaign, Mission Mars--Keep Walking India,&amp;nbsp;celebrates a remarkable story that underscores India’s progress. This story exemplifies the optimism and creativity that keeps us walking. We want to inspire people to keep walking towards a better future as sometimes belief alone can help us take giant strides. For the first time, we are looking at a&amp;nbsp;culturally relevant idea seeded in Indian narrative and story of progress. The way Imran has presented the piece is amazing. We are betting big on the film to do well.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Set in the control room, the film revolves around the tense 25 minutes of the Mars Orbiter Mission, while telling in flashbacks the story of exciting events that took place over a course of 32 months and led up to the moment of occult on September 24, 2014. With a change in the way&amp;nbsp;content is consumed nowadays, the brand and director Khan decided to go with a short film rather than a feature.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aIAq9UEPSWU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the film, Diageo is looking at distribution network tie-up with Arre and Hotstar. It's also looking to premiere the movie on Star Movies HD Select on the day of Mangalayan anniversary (September 24). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stressing on the&amp;nbsp;importance of digital as a medium, Shahabadi added, “We are hosting it across television, OTT and other digital formats.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brand has&amp;nbsp;taken an omni-channel approach for this project. The marketing expert mentioned that they&amp;nbsp;have put in all their might behind the&amp;nbsp;year-long campaign. "We have put in large part of this year's budget on it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moving ahead, Diageo is continuing to put in efforts to make scotch more accessible to younger lot since “they don’t drink whiskey straight up”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shahabadi mentioned, “We have opened the world to make scotch more accessible to consumers, like Johnnie Walker Johnnie Ginger (a drink where scotch is served with ginger ale,&amp;nbsp;lemon and orange peel etc). These are the initiatives that we are taking to make the brand accessible to the younger lot.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Post this, there is a special edition Game of Thrones-inspired bottle, which Shahabadi said, will be available in November and December. “It is limited edition and we will launch it around the show launch next year,” he said.</news:description>

      <news:title>A look at birthday girl Kareena Kapoor's brand journey </news:title>
      <news:description>The ever-charming Kareena Kapoor Khan celebrates her 38th birthday today. Having spent almost a decade in the industry, the actress has given many blockbuster films such as, 3 Idiots, Jab We Met, Omkara, Heroine, Bajrangi Bhaijan and the recently released Veere di Wedding. Popularly knows as Bebo, Kareena blossomed into a versatile artiste, experimenting with different kinds of roles year after year. She doesn’t limit her role to movies only, in fact, she plays a dominant and powerful role in the world of advertising as well. Over the years, the lovely actress has associated with multiple brands across categories. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kareena Kapoor has emerged as one of the highest paid female brand ambassadors in India. She has endorsed various brands such as, Sony, Head &amp;amp; Shoulders, Colgate, Vivel Soaps, Berger Paints, Emami, ICI Paints, Boro Plus, Globus and Airtel. She reportedly&amp;nbsp;has an endorsement value of about Rs 3-4 crore for each endorsement. Bebo once revealed that she is very choosy in terms of representing or associating with a brand. She also said, being a vegetarian, she doesn’t endorse non-vegetarian food, alcohol and cigarettes, and refrain from the controversial products. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2013, Kareena Kapoor signed an endorsement deal with a real estate company worth&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;whopping&amp;nbsp;amount. After this deal, she was considered as the highest paid female brand ambassador in the industry. Five years ago, she signed a deal to endorse a lemonade brand and at that time the actress had 16 brands in her kitty altogether.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EC2c867ZZMc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Her association with Head &amp;amp; Shoulders is counted as the oldest. She was roped in to endorse the brand in 2007 and after a year, Saif Ali Khan also came on board to represent the brand, along with Kareena and over the years, both have done many campaigns for the brand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last month, Lakme launched the Kareena Kapoor Khan collection at the Lakme Fashion Week. The new range of premium makeup products called ‘Kareena Kapoor Khan by Lakme Absolute’ is the first ever makeup line launched by the actress. Her association with Lakme started in 2011.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2016, Kareena Kapoor came on a board to endorse the home pregnancy kit brand Prega News, when she was pregnant. In the same year, she rejected six brand offers that make products for babies and pregnant women, because she is very cautious about her image in front of viewers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following her comeback after pregnancy, the actress was seen endorsing a new brand. She was roped in as the brand ambassador for soft drink Rasna in February 2018. Last year, we also saw her as the brand ambassador of fashion clothing brand AND.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has always been a favourite among brands and that is why she has endorsed so many different products over the years right from laptops to shoes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cSIFVemLOEM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to brand expert Nupur Krishna, “We need to understand the deeper appeal of celebrities beyond the obvious glamour. The celebrity sells not just a brand name but also some degree of fantasy, aspiration, trust and expert power. Kareena Kapoor ticks off all the boxes that make her a good celebrity endorser. Coming from the Kapoor clan, she learned early how to live under the public eye and revel in media attention”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year, Kareena Kapoor decided to work for the social welfare and partnered with UNICEF as a good will brand ambassador, where she will spread awareness about the varied factors of pregnancy. a few months ago, Airbnb roped in the husband-wife couple and came up with a new campaign, where they were seen sharing their Airbnb experience in the UK.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kareeena Kapoor has always associated herself with big brands. Is it a strategy to maintain brand value in the ever competing celebrity endorsement market, we asked brand expert N Chandramouli, CEO, TRA Research and he said, “For a celebrity to have value to a brand, (s)he must not only have current following, but also a potential of future successes in the celebrity's field of work - so that the brand gets sustained value. Some brands need mere association with a famous face, and they will go for the ROI approach in finding the celebrity that fits their needs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, the endorsers' sheen erodes with brands very quickly and mercilessly. So any celebrity tries to extract maximum value in the time they are there in the limelight. Kareena, or any celebrity, comes with an endorsement expiry date, and they want to squeeze most of it while it lasts”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also said, “Female actor marriages are no reason for a brand not to take an endorsement from them. In fact sometimes marriage gives a boost to the couple-hood value of the duo, as happened in the Virat-Anushka bethrotal”.&lt;br&gt;While Nupur Krishna has a different take on this, “Kareena knew how to always stay in the limelight. Even after marriage and pregnancy she found ways to stay close to her fans through social media. While other actresses would avoid the public eye during pregnancy, Kareena boldly shared her heavily pregnant pictures on Instagram, along with her weight gain and then miraculous weight loss. She regularly shares her son Taimur’s pictures online. It is comparable to the appeal of the Kardashians. Her transparency and open lifestyle builds trust in her fans, especially when it comes to fashion and motherhood. Also, by being selective of the brands she chooses to endorse, she has made sure that her reputation and brand value is not adversely affected by those of her clients.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Brand Akshay Kumar: From action hero to common man's hero </news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;When the lines,&amp;nbsp;"Mein Jo Bolta Hu Woh Karta Hu, Aur Jo Mein&amp;nbsp;Nahi Bolta Woh Mein Definitely Karta Hu (I do whatever I say and I definitely do what I don’t say)" were written for the Akshay Kumar starrer&amp;nbsp;Rowdy Rathore, the makers sure knew what they were doing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;According to some media reports in&amp;nbsp;August, Akshay Kumar&amp;nbsp;has signed eight new brand&amp;nbsp;deals this year. Kumar is&amp;nbsp;currently endorsing 20 brands. According to Forbes' list of world's top 10 actors, Akshay Kumar ranked 7th with annual earnings of USD 40.5 million in 2018.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Akshay, Forbes&amp;nbsp;magazine writes, “One of Bollywood’s leading men has transitioned to socially-conscious roles, such as Toilet, a comedy supporting government campaigns to improve sanitation, and Padman, about a guy hoping to provide inexpensive sanitary pads to rural communities. He still mints millions from backend profits and endorsing some 20 brands, including Tata and Eveready.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Khiladi of Bollywood has surprised the world with&amp;nbsp;his&amp;nbsp;choice of films and characters that he has taken up over the past few years. From playing characters that looked straight out of Mills &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;Boons to giving villains a run for their money with his daredevil&amp;nbsp;action or&amp;nbsp;making the audience laugh with his comic timing, Akshay Kumar has done it all. Even more remarkable is&amp;nbsp;his transition to being a&amp;nbsp;civic hero, which he doesn't just project through his films but also endorsements. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harish Bijoor Brand Guru &amp;amp; Founder, Harish Bijoor Consults Inc, said, “From the angry young man clone to the action hero to the evangelist of a toilet and sanitary pad alike, this has given him a softer edge over every other hero. Brands that want that soft social edge are using this new&amp;nbsp;image to their advantage in their brand-endorsement deals with Akshay Kumar.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large" class="&lt;img src=" https:="" cms.exchange4media.com="" images="" photon="" plugins="" elrte="" pixel.gif"="" title="" rel="media5022433310605718" width="150" height="100"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hcbigW4e3aw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TvWIzgpAmAs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;“One thing has not changed about Akshay Kumar - the brand&amp;nbsp;credibility. People believe in him and any brand which is trusted will&amp;nbsp;grow. He is very precise and disciplined, which is a good thing for any brand,” said Jagdeep Kapoor, MD, Samsika Marketing Consultants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Echoing the similar thoughts, N. Chandramouli, CEO, TRA, believes that the actor embodies&amp;nbsp;this real India image, which makes it&amp;nbsp;easier for brands to connect with&amp;nbsp;consumers. “He is a successful, non- controversial actor. Being&amp;nbsp;practical and down-to-earth in real&amp;nbsp;life and even in his&amp;nbsp;choice of movies further makes him so loved. He is not really known to make&amp;nbsp;big budget movies, his movies are always in the Rs 10-15 crore&amp;nbsp;bracket&amp;nbsp;and then he&amp;nbsp;always makes money for the producers and everybody involved in the film.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Extending his film persona to real life, after doing the film&amp;nbsp;Toilet- Ek Prem Katha, the actor was soon&amp;nbsp;talking about Swachh Bharat in Harpic's new TVC. From endorsing&amp;nbsp;Hindustan Unilever’s indigenous range&amp;nbsp;Ayush Ayurveda&amp;nbsp;to creating awareness about using&amp;nbsp;sanitary pads without batting an eyelid, Kumar has become a&amp;nbsp;national hero of sorts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aEz-ylDK87w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4XG9OGTOG8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qo0ZG33w35E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;Kapoor feels&amp;nbsp;that every good&amp;nbsp;brand evolves and so does Kumar. "Akshay has gone through a process of evolution. He went through his time as a struggler, then came his Khiladi days, then he went up in terms of scale and was able to bring himself&amp;nbsp;up to a particular level with the&amp;nbsp;largest number of hits and Rs 100 crore club films to his name.&amp;nbsp;It is all because of the fact that the evolution that took place&amp;nbsp;was from a hazy brand to a precise purposeful brand," said&amp;nbsp;Kapoor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"The next stage of&amp;nbsp;evolution for the actor was solely&amp;nbsp;for the good of society. He has been able to evolve because he has climbed the ladder of credibility and&amp;nbsp;purpose and now shares the goodness across all ages and cultures. That he can carry great humour with the same intensity as he does action is another added advantage,” added Kapoor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from HUL's&amp;nbsp;Ayush and RB's&amp;nbsp;Harpic, Kumar endorses&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;variety of brands namely&amp;nbsp;Tata Motors, Honda Motorcycles, and Scooters India, Prince Pipes, RR Kables, Revital H, Relaxo Footwear, Fortune Oil, Policybazzar.com and many more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Just last month, the&amp;nbsp;Union Minister for Road Transport &amp;amp; Highways, Shipping, Water Resources, River Development, and Ganga Rejuvenation, Nitin Gadkari launched three short films for generating public awareness towards road safety with the actor and also appointed him as Road Safety Brand Ambassador.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xcDnHA5Prko" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-size:large"&gt;“You will hardly see Akshay Kumar endorsing a luxury brand. He always endorses social relevant,&amp;nbsp;economic brands. He embodies&amp;nbsp;such&amp;nbsp;unique characteristics. Like Aamir Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui, he has&amp;nbsp;his own bracket now. His&amp;nbsp;image is&amp;nbsp;relatable for&amp;nbsp;many Indians&amp;nbsp;therefore his brand value is constantly&amp;nbsp;on the rise, which is rare,” said Chandramouli.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Building digital democracy through Indian languages</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;While digital democracy is a fascinating idea, it cannot be achieved without multilingual Internet access. The Indian market is yet to arrive at a stage where local languages earn a strong place in the digital space. As of now, English continues to be the dominating language on Internet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a panel dialogue organised during an event in New Delhi recently, industry experts discussed about&amp;nbsp;democratising India’s Internet through changing tech policies and few other means. The experts talked about the probable befitting measures to bring about an explosion of Indian languages online so that a business built on a local language is not ignored for one built on English.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moderating the session was Menaka Doshi, Managing Editor, BloombergQuint, who questioned the panel on whether there was a need for a tech public policy support or the market opportunity was enough to be able to drive innovation, growth and monetisation to democratise India’s Internet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Responding to this, Manish Dhingra, Co-Founder, Director &amp;amp; CEO, Mediology Software, agreed that the market is huge, as around 500 million new Indian language users would be coming online by 2021 in India. He said, “Indian entrepreneurs do need tech public policy but they seldom expect anything coming from the government. We find our own way out at times, as entrepreneurs are known for being good at analysing the potential in the market. But having a public policy will surely speed up the process.” Having said that, Dhingra also talked about government’s active role in the payment space that worked out well for the public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the need for a public policy, Ankush Sachdeva, Co-founder &amp;amp; CEO, ShareChat, was of the opinion that such policies would always prove to be beneficial for a firm. Sachdeva said, “There’s need of a pro-active approach from the government’s end to figure out the target audience specific to online platforms and thereby push content accordingly to those platforms. With the support of the government, growth of companies built on regional languages can always be up-scaled easily.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussing the specific areas in which government should enable local language Internet, Sourabh Gupta, Co-founder &amp;amp; CEO, Vernacular.ai, said while companies in the private sector are looking to build apps for the public, government should help them have access to the widely decentralised data required for their projects, by collating it on a single platform. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order to create India’s Internet, Arvind Pani, Co-founder &amp;amp; CEO of Reverie Language Technologies, pitched for government’s involvement in&amp;nbsp;resolving issues at the infrastructure level. According to Pani, there is an urgent need for a strong representation body that can define standards for Indian languages. He expects the government to contribute a lot more at the fundamental block building level.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shifting focus to the level of innovation in private sector firms such as Google &amp;amp; Facebook etc to scale up local language Internet in India, Doshi questioned the panellists if there were any shortcomings that needed to be overcome. Responding to this, Pani pointed out at how the focus on local languages has been quite low so far. With respect to innovation, he said that it could come from both big and small companies. Citing Sharechat’s example, he mentioned how start-ups were looking at building products keeping in mind India, the multilingual land and not primarily an English-speaking country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharing the challenges that ShareChat had to face, Sachdeva said, “It was difficult to attract capital as most investors were not keen on spending on an app that engaged in local content be it Hindi or any other language.” However, in such a scenario, Jio was a big enabler that opened up a huge moment for India, following which various big firms endorsed the new Indian Internet users surfing in local languages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Dhingra, the biggest challenge Mediology Software had to face while working with Indian language publishers was monetisation. Despite their user base being large, they struggled with monetisation. He said the needle turned for them when Google increased the number of Indian languages that could be monetised. Contributing to the discussion, Gupta re-iterated the need for a tech public policy that can expedite both online transactions and the process of consuming content. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apart from discussing the need for a tech public policy, the panel also shared inputs on whether e-commerce was enabled fully in local languages for Indians &amp;amp; if not, was lack of trust in its buying capacity in the market a major reason behind it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gupta, meanwhile, pointed out that lack of expertise in the local language domain was one of the major reasons behind the slow growth of local language Internet. He then said how computational linguistics and language experts could help overcome the challenges. Sachdeva from ShareChat was of the view that the government could play a crucial role in incentivising highly experienced people working for big firms abroad to come back to India and help build solutions for growth of India’s Internet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The session was organised by&amp;nbsp;Quint-Hindi &amp;amp; Google India.  &lt;/p&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Watch: In-video advertising is the near future: Neha Singh Warrier, Mirriad</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;An Initiative by Bloomberg Quint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Neha Singh Warrier, Vice President Sales, India - Mirriad spoke to exchange4media about how engaging the consumer must be at the heart of everything related to content and how smart content marketing can significantly help reduce brand’s overall marketing costs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the media around content- marketing evolved?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s very important to measure what people are doing. We are not into product placement model because a brand could decide to get into a movie or show two years in advance but you don’t know whether that particular platform will be successful in terms of rating, whether it will be released at all or whether the brands will get enough visibility for what they really set out to do; and if they are placing all their money on one particular content it’s too much to resist. So, when we partnered ourselves with a content partner, we are basically offering hundreds of shows where a brand can contextually get in using our technology. OTT ventures are growing by almost 35 per cent, within that, the maximum growth is coming from the non-metro cities. Brands need to know the ROI, the money they put behind the platform.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on the detailed content-marketing strategy required for the success of most organisations?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In- video advertising is going to be a very strong leg as a marketing strategy, if they want to reach out to their consumers because the trend is not just seen on the OTT platforms but on TV as well; that’s why you see movies that are aired with just one-break because brands do not want people to move on to another channel/platform. In- video advertising and branded content are going to be a very important marketing strategy going forward, but it has to be non-intrusive and most importantly the turnaround time has to be quick.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What according to you are the key performance indicators for a content marketing campaign?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are very important factors that a brand should seek. I think the biggest challenge that some of the brands that we interact with is the messaging that they are trying to do; whether the recall is there, new brands have the challenge of becoming the awareness quotient. I think it’s important to do a case study after running a successful branded content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content marketing can help reduce your overall marketing costs. Do you agree?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would say smart content marketing can help reduce. Brands are forced to put lot of money in traditional form of advertising. If you do smart content marketing and compliment it with traditional marketing, it will become an important tool to save your cost and put your money where people really consume your brands message in different ways, not just one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EDNs_5SvmB8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Honday City and Dentsu One collaborate to launch new campaign 'Forget the Toys'&#13;
&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>The Honda City, with its 20 year legacy, has been one of the most celebrated sedans in the country. For over 7.35 lakh customers, the City is the symbol that best resonates with their stature and world view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The objective of this campaign was to drive consideration by re-affirming the leadership high ground of the Honda City with young sedan intenders. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For over 20 years, the Honda City has consistently built relevance for sedan intenders. The task for this campaign, therefore, was to appeal to the desires and ambitions of the younger, progressive, more assertive Indian.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Young sedan intenders, aren’t swayed by mere style and glamour, gravitas sans personality isn’t an option either. They aspire to have a point of view that’s decidedly worlds ahead, they aren’t content to follow but want to assert their leadership and are more confident than ever about demonstrating that stance and presence to the rest of the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The idea, therefore, was to pitch the Honda City as the sedan of choice for this customer. Given the rich legacy of leadership in the category, the unmistakable stamp of credibility, substance and style that comes with a Honda, the City stands tall as the perfect companion for our customer to assert his/her identity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign, ‘Forget the Toys’ is a statement that’s reflective of not being swayed by superficial pomp and making choices that are truly in keeping with one’s ambitions – and that make one stand head and shoulders above the rest. The campaign is led by a film that shows the protagonist looking down at the cars below from his high office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We hear the man’s voice saying, From here, they all seem like toys… they watch you, they copy you and pretend to be you… but you know, deep down they all know, they can never be you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign was initiated by impactful OOH advertising across India and the TVC is On Air from 15th Sep along with a full Digital marketing plan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rajesh Goel, Sr VP and Director, Sales and Marketing, Honda Cars India said, “The new campaign of Honda City has been rolled out during the peak festival buying season. The campaign celebrates the aura of the Honda City being the most aspirational car brand with a 20 year legacy, over 7.35 lakh customers and has been an epitome of quality. It resonates aptly with the City buyer who makes his smart choices and is more direct and assertive about them.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Titus Upputuru, National Creative Director, Dentsu One said, “I was standing in my office by the window when this idea struck me. When you look at the world below, you see that everything is so tiny. The ad then sort of wrote by itself. It’s a bold stance and we thought it’s time the brand had a clear perspective on the world around. Only Honda City could say ‘Forget the Toys”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abhinav Kaushik, Executive Vice President, Dentsu One said, “The Honda City is a true legend that needs no introduction. It is one of the longest running brands in India and therefore keeping the client brief in mind we looked at the brand truth and played on its unique rich legacy, thereby clearly asserting its leadership position. There is a lot of pride in owning a Honda City among the consumers and this pride has been well reflected in the campaign.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the video:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

During his career, Iyer has a multi-faceted profile-- besides being an ace communication professional, he has been a leading columnist, a development sector professional, an equal rights activist, a front-runner in the campaign for decriminalization of all consensual sex under Section 377.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the appointment, Prateek N Kumar, CEO &amp;amp; MD, NeoNiche, said. “Having known Harish for over a decade now, I have seen him emerge both as a proactive citizen who organises campaigns on a timely basis and as a creative professional.

      <news:title>Amway India launches new ‘Protein 4 Children’ campaign</news:title>
      <news:description>Amway India, the FMCG direct selling company has launched a ‘Protein 4 Children’ campaign. As per a recent study published in the Indian Medical Gazette, protein deficiency is a major concern in India with more than 80 per cent of the Indian diets being deficient in protein. Another article published in the Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care reveals that around 50 per cent children in India are protein deficient. Amway’s ‘Protein 4 Children’ campaign is focused on the fact that the protein requirement of children almost doubles up between the age group of 5 to 12 years to support vital growth and the requirement increases further when they reach adolescence age.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The company has stepped up its efforts to propagate the benefits of protein to the parents by rolling out a comprehensive campaign ‘Protein 4 Children’. As a part of the campaign, Amway is launching a series of initiatives to support and educate Amway direct sellers as well as preferred customers across the country on the need of protein supplementation amongst children. The company has also launched a Protein Calculator app that helps in assessing approximate protein intake, making it easier to identify the gaps, if any. Amway has introduced a series of trivia - ‘Did you know’ with interesting factoids on social media, to improve knowledge on the need for protein amongst children. Besides this, Amway has created fun and tasty recipes, in association with leading nutritionists that can be easily prepared using Nutrilite All Plant Protein Powder. &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the market potential, Sundip Shah, Chief Marketing Officer, Amway India, said, “The campaign is based on the findings presented by Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care2 that around 50% children in India are protein deficient and targeted at mothers who bear the prime responsibility of nutrition and health of children in our country. With this campaign we aim to reinforce the importance of protein for children in their growth years. If the required amount of Protein is not available from the regular diet then supplementation must be considered.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the need for protein among Children,&amp;nbsp;Ajay Khanna,&amp;nbsp;Category Head – Nutrition &amp;amp; Wellness,&amp;nbsp;Amway India, said,&amp;nbsp;“The formative years are critical for a child’s overall development because this is the period when the linear growth happens most rapidly. Hence, they require a jumpstart to their overall development. The appropriate protein intake is crucial for organ function, muscle repair, and a healthy immune system. As per ICMR, protein requirement doubles in the age group of 5 to 12 years. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the reality is that nearly 50 per cent of children are protein deficient. As a brand that believes in extending good health and wellness to all, these statistics are alarming. We all are aware that children are picky about their food choices, thus ensuring proper intake of nutrition becomes a huge challenge for mothers. Our effort is to make protein consumption simple and attractive for kids by showing ways to add the same to things they love to consume on a daily basis. One of the unique characteristics of Nutrilite All Plant Protein is that it can be mixed with anything as it has a neutral taste. At Amway, we believe in maintaining good health. We foresee Amway’s&amp;nbsp;Nutrilite All Plant Protein Powder playing a major role in fulfilling protein gaps. Protein supplementation is a key solution for mothers to lay a strong growth foundation for their child’s future.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Most children do not consume a balanced diet that includes proteins, whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and a small amount of healthy fats. Unlike fats and carbohydrates, proteins are not stored in the body. Hence, there is a need for continuous replenishment. Protein is the basic building block for muscles, bones and other body components and is essential for body’s growth &amp;amp; maintenance. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amway’s Nutrilite All Plant Protein Powder is&amp;nbsp;an easy to digest, 100% all-plant formula that supplies 9 essential amino acids that need to be replenished on a daily basis especially among the children to ensure maximum growth potential. The tri-blend of soy, wheat, and pea provides the right combination of proteins and amino acids that ensure children get a healthy intake of protein and essential nutrients on a regular basis. With a neutral taste, Nutrilite All Plant Protein Powder has a versatile usage and can be mixed with juices, milkshakes, buttermilk, soups, and lentils, without changing the original taste.</news:description>

      <news:title>News18 launches Google Progressive Web Apps in Hindi and Bengali</news:title>
      <news:description>News18, has worked with the Google team in India to launch Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) in Hindi and Bengali. For the uninitiated, PWAs are unique Google products that combine the best qualities of apps and websites. So while consumers may be on the &lt;a href="https://hindi.news18.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://hindi.news18.com&lt;/a&gt; website on their smartphones, via the Google Chrome browser, the website will have the look, feel and functionality of an app. PWAs are much lighter than other apps, they load much faster, consume much less data and storage and are therefore accessible to wider audiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;News18 offers content in nine regional languages, in addition to English and Hindi, in order to cater to the diverse Indian audience. “With the exponential growth that the Indian market has seen in content consumption and engagement on mobile, it is important that our products deliver our experiences to every relevant user. Given the accessibility that our multi-lingual coverage offers, our technology is now aligned to the same vision of democratising access to news,” said Mitul Sangani, Business Head, News18 Languages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With 80&amp;nbsp;per cent&amp;nbsp;of News18’s audiences accessing the information on their smartphones, these state-of-the-art PWAs ensure speed of access and reliability under poor network conditions and enhance user engagement. Network18’s Chief Product Officer Avinash Mudaliar confirms that the Hindi PWA, which was released first, has driven significant improvements in performance and consumer behaviour. He said, “Better load times have enabled us to provide a superior user experience. The proof is in the numbers. Users are spending more time on our pages, and engaging more with our content.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PWAs also offer the ability for users to subscribe to the publisher’s push notifications. Over 3 lakh users have subscribed to News18 Hindi’s push notifications since it was launched.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manish Maheshwari, Network18 Digital CEO said, “Progressive web applications have shown a lot of potential in improving access to quality content in the Indian market. Network18 Digital is one of the largest digital publishers in India, with over two dozen properties across formats in all major Indian languages. Given the success of the News18 Hindi PWA, we rolled out another one in Bengali and will be rolling out more of our other properties in the months to come.”</news:description>

The initiative has garnered support from marquee advertisers including Dabur, Cipla, Unicharm, Dettol, and Gulf Oil.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a part of the special contact initiative, Discovery Kids will showcase a specially created movie offering practical tips to children to handle difficult day to day situations such as a powerful elder grabbing a young one et al. The aim is to make the child more aware about the situations that can arise and offer a guidance towards a plausible solution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vikram Tanna, Head of Advertising Sales, Discovery Communications India, said, “This special school contact program will work towards enlightening young minds about learning practical ways to defending themselves in the hour of need.

Oral hygiene is an important part of being fit &amp;amp; healthy. If you look after your body and your eating habits, it's also equally important to look after your basic oral and dental hygiene. However, brushing your teeth is generally seen as a mundane and routine activity. So, there's a need to educate consumers about oral-care and its impact on overall well-being. With this initiative, Dabur has taken the onus of promoting oral hygiene among school kids."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Immuno Boosters by Cipla Health is proud to partner with Discovery Kids in their School Contact Program. It allows the brand the opportunity to strengthen our connect with kids by educating them about the importance of 'Suraksha and immunity' via a much-loved character like Little Singham.

      <news:title>Watch: Engaging content can dramatically reduce media cost: Anantha Nayak, Cipla Health</news:title>
      <news:description>With the advent of the digital age and the new channels of communication that it has created – along with an influx in the sheer quantity of advertising that has turned many consumers off traditional ad messaging – brands are beginning to discover the potential of true consumer engagement. On these lines, Anantha Nayak, CEO, Cipla Health Ltd, spoke to exchange4media about how engaging the consumer must be&amp;nbsp;at the heart of everything related to content and how content marketing can significantly help reduce a brand’s overall marketing costs.&lt;br&gt;Edited excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about the role of technology in content marketing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technology plays a critical role here based on the various touch-points where consumers are consuming media. And that’s where every company and marketer has to step up to the need of the moment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the media around content-marketing evolved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Media has evolved phenomenally. There are people with infinite sources who can engage consumers at every touch-point such as ATL, TV, digital, etc. But there are people with scarce resources. And for them, TV and digital play a big role.  Media consumption habits have also changed so dramatically. And that’s where it brings an opportunity as well as a challenge such as which media to engage, which consumers and at what point in time.  And to that extent, I would genuinely believe that every consumer has far more choices and you have to be very selective about which way to engage him or her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on the detailed content-marketing strategy required for the success of most organisations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you don’t have the right content it’s like throwing money down the gutter. I would definitely not do any communication where the content is not engaging the consumer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What according to you are the key performance indicators for a content marketing campaign?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;First of all, do you know your consumer? Who is your consumer? Second is what is his or her barrier and what are you trying to overcome? And why should he listen to you? Do you have a story that engages him and why should he believe you? I think it’s in the order of knowing the consumer and taking him through the path to purchase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content marketing can help reduce your overall marketing costs. Do you agree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes and it is the best part of it. Absolutely, not only effectiveness but also efficiency in the cost part of it (improves). With engaging content, the media cost can dramatically reduce by a huge, huge portion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8jFKT6Ztyiw?rel=0&amp;wmode=transparent" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-- In association with Bloomberg Quint&lt;/strong&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>How Do You Track ROI In The Ever-Evolving World Of Influencer Marketing?</news:title>
      <news:description>The booming digital landscape has completely&amp;nbsp;changed the way we do business and the way customers access information. Recent studies have found that&amp;nbsp;buyers are increasingly&amp;nbsp;getting influenced by information found on social media. With&amp;nbsp;television&amp;nbsp;ads you cannot effectively target your audience due to its one size fits all stance&amp;nbsp;but with influencer&amp;nbsp;marketing, where things are more pertinent,&amp;nbsp;audience&amp;nbsp;reach can be&amp;nbsp;far more&amp;nbsp;effective. That influencers help&amp;nbsp;in building brand&amp;nbsp;credibility is of course an added bonus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While influencer marketing has been present&amp;nbsp;since a few years now, the world is increasingly waking up to&amp;nbsp;its potency now with social media playing as the driving force.&amp;nbsp;So what is it that&amp;nbsp;makes influencers&amp;nbsp;influential? With a large following&amp;nbsp;on the web and social media, influencers&amp;nbsp;spend a significant amount of&amp;nbsp;time building their own brand name and make sure to reach&amp;nbsp;the audience organically.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2018 has witnessed&amp;nbsp;several&amp;nbsp;brands, namely Canon India, Kerala Tourism, Nykaa, KFC,&amp;nbsp;American Express, Air Bnb, adding the power of an influencer&amp;nbsp;to their marketing mix.&amp;nbsp;The Association of National Advertisers surveyed 158 brands to examine the state of influencer marketing&amp;nbsp;and found that 75 per&amp;nbsp;cent use influencer marketing&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;43 per&amp;nbsp;cent&amp;nbsp;are planning to increase budgets in the next year. According to a&amp;nbsp;latest research by&amp;nbsp;Linqia, out of 86% marketers who used influencer marketing in 2017, a whopping percentage&amp;nbsp;found it useful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While influencer marketing is not new, the ways&amp;nbsp;how brands&amp;nbsp;and influencers themselves are adapting their processes and creating new best practices to truly evolve in this rapidly growing space is exciting.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Few trends in influencer marketing:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brands are trying to lock in Long-Term Relationships with their Preferred Influencers:&amp;nbsp;“Since most marketers by now have deployed and seen success from their pilot campaigns with influencers, brands want to work with influencers that fit their brand on a longer-term basis. A part of this is also driven by most influencers endorsing a range of brands leading to a cluttered feed. These long-term partnerships are allowing brands to not only create authentic content with these influencers but also leverage them to test and co-create products as well as get market insights," said Arushi Sharma - Head of Brand Partnerships &amp;amp; Strategy at Chtrbox.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashish Dhruva, Vice President - Marketing, Cleartrip, says, "Marketers are increasingly focusing on precise targeting when looking at influencer marketing. As the risks and potential of influencer marketing are surfacing, the axis of choice of influencers is shifting to the quality of followers."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Shradha Agarwal, COO, Grapes Digital, “The latest trend in influencer marketing in India is "Youth Marketing and Affiliate Programmes". Till now influencers were being used for branding and reach, now a lot of brands have started with youth ambassador programmes. For e.g.: Superstar by&amp;nbsp;Paytm&amp;nbsp;Mall, where every product sold through an influencer gets them an X percentage. This is very common in US and Europe where every influencer has a unique discount code&amp;nbsp;but in India it hasn’t picked up much. But now this trend is coming where there are students specialising as sellers rather&amp;nbsp;than just influencers."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter micro-influencers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Micro- influencers are influencers with less than 25,000 followers, who are recognised by online communities for their knowledge and expertise in a particular topic. Also, the content that micro-influencers produce resonates with their audience because they are relatable. They have&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;mid-sized audience&amp;nbsp;with dedicated, highly engaged followers. They tend to have a much more personalised way of engaging as compared to an established celebrity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Smaller brands which don’t have&amp;nbsp;huge&amp;nbsp;marketing budgets started approaching micro influencers who are easy to approach and cost-effective. Influencers have a definite set of followers and audience with whom they engage with&amp;nbsp;on a&amp;nbsp;regular basis. This makes it very easy for brands to reach out&amp;nbsp; to the target audience&amp;nbsp;at an effective cost,&amp;nbsp; at the same time providing&amp;nbsp;them with quality&amp;nbsp;reach," said&amp;nbsp;Abdulla Basha, Co-founder of Social Frontier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Partnering with a micro influencer is a good option for brands as this can be a long-term relationship. Influencers can create genuine and more impactful content for their followers. But while choosing the influencer we need to be very particular and objective driven," he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Tapping into the Micro influencer space right now is a great bet for&amp;nbsp;brands. Not only are we seeing better ROI overall, you never know when there is a tomorrow’s AIB hidden somewhere in that lot. Getting them on board at an early stage at a lower cost can prove to be really beneficial and profitable for a brand,"&amp;nbsp;said&amp;nbsp;Sharma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"At Cleartrip, we work with over 100 micro bloggers every month to engage with the travel community who add value to travellers' decision-making journey with interesting information about destinations, trends, new insights,&amp;nbsp;etc.," said Dhruva.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of the advantages of micro&amp;nbsp;influencers,&amp;nbsp;Agarwal said, “Micro influencers make for&amp;nbsp;a good choice because they offer more value at&amp;nbsp;less cost. They create multiple contextual content pieces based on the USP of the brand and product,&amp;nbsp;and put together, their reach is far&amp;nbsp;more targeted or at least&amp;nbsp;equivalent to that of a&amp;nbsp;celebrity."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROI of Influencer Marketing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Without tracking ROI, it becomes difficult to analyse how effective is influencer&amp;nbsp;marketing&amp;nbsp;for a&amp;nbsp;brand.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In its new avatar, influencer marketing is now relying on pockets of micro-influencers to help the brand message reach&amp;nbsp;small communities. The ROI on influencer marketing can go either way,&amp;nbsp;it's up to the marketing teams to figure ways to get the best bang for the buck. Today, on an average, one would burn about Rs&amp;nbsp;50-200&amp;nbsp;on CPM costs on any non-influencer channel such as&amp;nbsp;Facebookor&amp;nbsp;Google&amp;nbsp;display. Compared to the per post cost that influencers charge, another&amp;nbsp;measure is to see the reach achieved for the same. Many a&amp;nbsp;times, even if it gives lesser reach than other digital channels, what makes up for it&amp;nbsp;is the engagement and&amp;nbsp;interactions you see on the product endorsed, which very few brand campaigns on their own are able to muster," said&amp;nbsp;Meera Iyer, Head of Marketing, Melorra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agarwal feels there are two methods,&amp;nbsp;which marketers can track to achieve ROI. "One is reach and other is engagement rate on the content.&amp;nbsp;If the sales trend picks up,&amp;nbsp;then sales will become a big KPI," she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jatin Modi, Founder &amp;amp; CEO, FrogIdeas, has a different take on this.&amp;nbsp;"Leveraging influencers to take a brand's message forward is picking up as a key marketing trend to cater to the new-age, intelligent consumer. What's crucial is to use influencers to your brand's advantage intelligently. Numbers or volume of postings, for instance, don't mean as much as a well-thought strategy mapped on real reach, intelligent conversations and conversions. Only then&amp;nbsp;can micro-influencers add value to a&amp;nbsp;business' ROI," he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Influencer marketing is still evolving. While rise in engagement, traffic and impressions is where it begins, the focus should also be on aspects like the quality of impact, time saved to create the reach and brand awareness," added Dhruva.</news:description>

      <news:title>&amp;TV refreshes brand philosophy with new campaign, new shows </news:title>
      <news:description>&amp;amp;TV, the second general entertainment channel of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd’s (ZEEL), has unveiled its new campaign, ‘Hai Khaas Har Andaaz’. The channel has also refreshed its show line-up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Hai Khaas Har Andaaz’ has been created by Lowe Lintas and celebrates the “non-conformist mindset” of the new-age viewers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the occasion, Punit Misra, CEO, ZEEL - India Broadcast Business, looked back at the journey of &amp;amp;TV. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Entertainment began in the real sense 25 years ago when Zee TV was born in October, 1992. Last year, we celebrated our 25th anniversary and we are very happy and proud that the journey we started with 90 crore Indians in 1992 has 1.2 billion people today. Last year, we announced are new identity-- extraordinary together-- and we are really happy to be continuing that journey as we share another new chapter in the history of our business. India has changed since 1992 and viewers have evolved,” said Misra.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He added, “&amp;amp;TV was conceptualised three years ago in 2015. The channel was born for the new-age and experimental Indian. As a viewer (then I was not a part of ZEEL), when I first saw the full-page ad for &amp;amp;TV, I realised how the channel created a very strong brand presence in a very-cluttered market. It immediately made an impact. With our unique brand point-of-view-led content creation approach, the &amp;amp;TV team has crafted stories and characters that &amp;amp;dians will fall in love with.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New campaign &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Sharing her thoughts on the brand film, Prathyusha Agarwal, CMO, ZEEL, said the network had been working on the content journey and a deep-dive was happening on how these &amp;amp;dians are different and want more. Brand &amp;amp; aims to disrupt the entertainment space with content that caters to the non-conformist &amp;amp;dian mindset. &lt;br&gt;“Our new brand campaign ‘Hai Khaas Har Andaaz’ is pegged on a simple premise-- today’s Indian is multi-dimensional in their thoughts, actions and aspirations, and seamlessly traverse between their many roles in life and excel in each. It’s truly an &amp;amp; and not an OR world for them as they add meaning to and fulfil every relationship, value themselves and their work, go beyond what society expects them to and actualise all their &amp;amp;s along the way. Through this campaign, we celebrate this ability of &amp;amp;dians to expand the canvas to accomplish their desires and the multiplicity of idea captures their diverse hues in full glory.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content strategy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The channel has announced a new line-up of shows for the coming months, starting off with the recently launched ‘Perfect Pati’. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Next up will be a live signing reality show for kids ‘Love Me India’ at 9pm on weekends. The show will bring together three musicians as judges -- Guru Randhawa, Himesh Reshammiya and Neha Bhasin-- along with four singers as zonal captains-- Abhijeet Sawant, Anusha Mani, Bhoomi Trivedi and Navraj Hans. Also widening its bouquet of fiction offerings, the channel will present a fantasy ‘Vikram Betaal Ki Rahasya Gaatha’. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Vishnu Shankar, Head, &amp;amp;TV, “As a channel, we have shows from all genres and we will keep experimenting with the content. With ‘Love Me India’, we are actually raising the bar. It will be a first-of-its-kind live kids reality show where we have given the power to the consumer.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“&amp;amp;TV has a very good start. It had a very successful launch. We opened with 4.5 market share and we have touched 7.2. I have got this channel in a very good state. Now taking this forward, we need to up the game. That's how we come up with new brand thought. For every content, there has to be &amp;amp; factor.”</news:description>

      <news:title>Short-form content is a big part of our content strategy: Ridhima Lulla, Eros Group</news:title>
      <news:description>After months of anticipation Eros Now, the over-the-top (OTT) platform by Eros International is finally out with its first original series called 'Side Hero', an eight-episode comedy series directed by Rohan Sippy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The show will be out on September 24. It stars actor Kunaal Roy Kapur as a fictionalised version of himself, trying to become a lead hero to prove that acting is not just a ‘hobby’. Its pilot was first released in 2015, but the show finally made its cut this year with a new pilot. Ridhima Lulla, Chief Content Officer, Eros Group, shares the reason behind the three-year-hold, reception to Eros Now’s original short form content until now and content strategy:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why did it take a while for ‘Side Hero’ to be launched?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rohan (Sippy) and Kunal (Roy Kapoor) came to us with the idea in 2015. We shot the pilot then (something which we do for a lot of our series). We tested and got different reactions from audience across India. So it was necessary to shoot with our recent learnings and implement those changes to make the story stronger. So it was completely shot this year. The pilot was reshot. It took a while. All shows need that much time in development and writing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How will ‘Side Hero’ stick out from the rest especially in the comedy genre?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We don’t have fun, situational modern comedy. That was the kind of thinking behind the show. Rohan and Kunal have written a lot of it themselves. A lot of it is improvised. As a platform we didn’t want to take ourselves too seriously. We want people to just have fun. This show definitely does that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is its TG?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s primarily targeted at the youth because they understand this sort of situational self-deprecating comedy. It does relate to other people. Older people find it funny as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s in store for the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will be announcing something soon. The next original will be out next month. It will be interesting as it will cater to a wider audience. We have got some exciting things lined up in the teen space in the next two years. We have been working on it for quite some time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We don’t want to restrict ourselves to any genre. We want to go from comedy, drama to mythology and fantasy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the reception been to the platform’s short-form original content so far?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s doing really well especially the ‘Black and White Interviews’ with the film cast where we ask them fun things about their life. This is because content is not enough on its own. It’s nice to get to know the people behind the content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the code to crack the original content strategy in India’s digital space?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is no code to crack. Content speaks for itself. ‘Meri Nimmo’ on its own is enough to make people want to watch it. In ‘Sacred Games’ writing was its hero. So it all depends on the story. Supporting new talent and writers, making them the heroes of your show are something I have tried to implement within our content strategy. This is our brightest time to shine. As long as you pick the right people to work with and the energy is good between them, the product will eventually speak for itself.</news:description>

      <news:title>The role of Corp Comm has become more strategic than ever: Ruchika Mehta, The Park Hotels</news:title>
      <news:description>From managing press coverage to having a bigger say in the strategic affairs of the organisation, the role of corporate communications has come full circle. In a world where a single Tweet can undo years of brand building exercise, it is the corporate communications professional who ensures that the brand is well represented. With brand identity becoming synonymous with brand longevity and thus business and revenues, Ruchika Mehta, Corporate Director, Communications and Public Relations, The Park Hotels tells us how corporate communications has taken on a new meaning in today’s time and age.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537427601_Bdkcv3_IPRCCA-logo_%281%29.jpg" style="width:350px;height:164px;float:right"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited Excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What kind of shift has corporate communications witnessed over the years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Corporate Communications space has changed drastically over the years. It has become more strategic in its approach and it has become a lot more evolved than what it used to be. Earlier corporate communications was restricted to public relations, which was mostly about managing the press. Now it has grown in its scope. As I said, it has become super strategic than ever because the CEOs and the top management work directly with the communications people now. To put it simply, the shift is a lot more about brand image and brand reputation than just sending information to public at large. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has growth of digital and social platforms impacted the communications space in your view?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we talk about the digital medium, though it provides new possibilities and opportunities, it also comes with its own set of challenges. With the widespread reach of digital and social and its ‘always-on’ nature, reputation management has become more critical and even difficult at times, because you have to be available everywhere at every given point of time. Also, the digital medium is difficult to control beyond a point and one has to ensure that the right messaging happens and there is the right perspective of your organisation that is being shared. Also, crisis communication is becoming difficult; you don't have time anymore, earlier you would have couple of hours to figure out what to do; now you have to figure out in couple of minutes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How integrated has the communications role become with the marketing and sales aspect of the organisation compared to what it used to be a decade back? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is important to remember that the image of the brand is in the custody of the communications department and it is our responsibility to see that the brand image is reflected well. Once the brand image is reflected well, it automatically impacts the overall business potential. So it is a critical role in that sense. We may not be directly impacting the revenue but we are definitely involved in the process of creating revenue. We help marketing and sales to achieve what they want to achieve by creating campaigns and by creating messaging that would help them to reach and achieve their targets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, in your view, what kind of trends will define communications space as we move forward?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;First of all, when it comes to marketing spends; we are witnessing a new trend. Traditionally, it was television and print which was a communicators preferred medium but now a big chunk of these spends are going to digital because that is where my consumer is. As we move forward we will also see story telling becoming all the more important for brands. This in turn would help brands create distinct identity for themselves, so whoever will be the best story teller is going to be the better brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we see video is becoming very important and going forth video communication messaging is going to become even more important. Also, the use of algorithms and artificial intelligence is going to redefine the communications space. In fact, it has already become important because we are constantly being guided by the data led insights about our customers and this is going to become more refined as we move forward.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vn8sII5KQrw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

Directed by versatile director Rohan Sippy, Side Hero stars Kunaal Roy Kapur as a fictionalised version of himself, trying to become a lead hero and prove that acting is not just a ‘hobby’.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, comedy is the most consumed genre across the digital ecosystem, especially content that is hilarious and brutally honest. Understanding the trend, Eros Now has kick-started its originals with a fresh comedy series that highlights the funny side of being ‘almost famous’. Side Hero is a unique series that intends to offer content which has never been seen before by the viewers. The show’s quirky tagline ‘Isko Kaun Dekhega’ takes a dig at Kunaal Roy Kapur’s character showcasing Side Hero’s self-deprecating humour. The tagline is also a reflection of Eros Now’s filmy and vibrant brand personality, further fuelling its endeavour of offering the viewers with the content of their choice. Eros International’s objective has always been to provide the best in entertainment and with Side Hero, Eros Now takes the company’s 40-year-old legacy a step ahead. It strives to further raise the bar with its originals in the digital streaming ecosystem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With an aim to engage with the audience and build the craze for ‘Side Hero’, Eros Now has undertaken a robust 360° marketing campaign. The digital entertainment platform plans to strategically encompass marketing elements such as on-air promotions, creating social media buzz, on-ground association, outdoor campaigns, radio spots and various PR tools, making it an impactful campaign. Side Hero will be extensively promoted on major broadcast channels through a 15-day long campaign alongside aggressive promotions on leading radio stations in Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore. Eros Now will also tactically use outdoor medium for promotions at 100+ sites in Mumbai. As of August 2018, Eros Now enjoys viewership from 100+ countries and further strengthening its global presence, Eros Now will leverage its  partnerships with leading international brands like Xiaomi Mi TV, Dialog Axiata and more to present their original content across Asia and beyond.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking experiential on-ground entertainment to its influencers and stakeholders, Eros Now will host an open-air screening in Mumbai. The digital entertainment platform will also use its expertise across social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat for engaging the influencers and users alike. Building on Eros Now’s plan to provide high quality and versatile content, the original shows will be nothing short of a cinematic experience.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the launch, Ridhima Lulla, Chief Content Officer, Eros Group said, “With Eros Now originals, we are all geared to enhance our content offering and offer a myriad mix of never-seen-before content to our audience.

      <news:title>Crizal unveils new campaign featuring Shruti Haasan and Arjun Kapoor</news:title>
      <news:description>Essilor, the popular spectacle lenses company, unveils a new brand campaign for its Crizal brand of lenses for Essilor India, titled ‘Clearly the Best’. Starring Shruti Haasan and Arjun Kapoor, the youthful new campaign, demonstrates how Crizal lenses offer you the clearest vision. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Essilor constantly innovates to correct, protect and prevent risks to the eye health of more than millions of people worldwide every day. While there are cheaper lenses available in the market, none of them match up to the comprehensive, state-of-the-art technology that goes into the making of a Crizal lens. The campaign clearly communicates this benefit and aims to motivate young aspiring consumers of the country to go ahead and indulge in their day-to-day activities, because Crizal will always go the extra mile to protect their eyes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new ad reflects the youthful persona and establishes why Crizal is clearly the best for the young Indians. Ramachandran P, COO, Essilor India says, “Life can take you on many journeys, be prepared for whatever comes your way with Crizal lenses. Our business serves an essential purpose, improving lives by improving sight.  And  when it  comes  to  Crizal, we  deliver  what  we promised, clarity  like  no  other. Today, youthful Indians are more active and want the best when it comes to eye care. Through our latest ad we have communicated this growing lifestyle. To rope in Shruti Haasan and Arjun Kapoor in our new avatar was an ultimate choice; as they are someone who represents the youthful India and at the same time appreciate quality of eye care.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actor Arjun Kapoor on his association with the brand says, “Eye care is a critical aspect of my everyday life. While eyewear has become a fashion essential today, choosing the right lenses is critical for our visual health and Crizal has always stood for excellence in product quality. I feel that eyeglasses are not complete without anti-reflection lenses, especially for the youth of today, who are always on the go. The brand values of Crizal resonated with me, as I always look to buy products that stand out, are stylish and have a great value for money. Thus, it was an easy decision to associate with the brand as it’s clearly the best that makes you see better, look better and feel better. Brand Crizal, is the world leader in spectacle lenses and I am excited about our new association.”&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The charming piece of communication is clearly the best, says actor Shruti Haasan on her association with the brand. She confesses, “I am quite dependent on powered lenses, thus, eyeglasses are an integral part of my life and constant wear. This makes&amp;nbsp;Crizal a truly preferred choice for me. It provides a carefree spectacle experience, allowing me to enjoy every bit of my life’s adventures with maximum visual impact. I am happy to be associated with a brand, which is at the forefront of innovation,&amp;nbsp;R&amp;amp;D processes and optical technologies, thus, doing the utmost to improve and help maintain people’s visual health. It delivers, what it promises.”</news:description>

      <news:title>Bol – Love Your Bhasha: Key highlights of the event</news:title>
      <news:description>‘Bol – Love Your Bhasha' – an initiative by Quint Hindi and Google India, was held on Tuesday, 18 September, in Delhi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The day-long event brought together the brightest minds in business, media and publishing, to talk about the explosion of Indian languages online. This is the first large-scale inclusive day-long discussion of its kind, completely focussed on the growth and monetisation of Indian languages on the Internet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rajan Anandan, Google India Vice President, said that 95% of content consumed on YouTube is not in English, and predicted that the Indian language advertising market would reach Rs 6,000 crore by 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The speakers, including Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, spoke on the need for an inclusive digital space, using Indian languages for business, and democratising the Internet through tech policy. He said, “Regional Indian societies will be the ultimate beneficiaries of the Internet revolution.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The event threw up many such insights to power the spread of Indian languages online. Here are some of the highlights.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Need for Digital Inclusivity’&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on ‘digital inequality’, Arvind Pani, Co-founder and CEO of Reverie Language Technologies, shared an anecdote about how despite his schooling in Kendriya Vidyalaya, he lost touch with Hindi after school and English took over as his primary language of communication. “If I had to deliver this talk in Hindi, then I don’t know if I would be able to,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Calling out the bias against Hindi in the new-age education system, he reflected on the ‘dominance of English’ in higher education – students feel compelled to pick up English, which they might be weak in because subjects like engineering and medicine are English-medium. For each English medium student getting an admission in an engineering college, 10 non-English speaking students face rejection.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Pani also pointed out that the revolution in the telecom and media industries – booming in India – have included Indian languages.Yet, “Today, you ask anybody about how many alphabets there are in the English language, and they will say 26. But if you ask the same person how many alphabets there are in Hindi or other Indian languages – that need to be represented on a mobile phone or digital screen – you will get inconsistent answers,” said Pani.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Digital&amp;nbsp;Democracy&amp;nbsp;via&amp;nbsp;Indian Languages’&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amid a panel discussion on democratising India’s internet through changing tech policies, moderated by Bloomberg Quint’s Managing Editor Menaka Doshi, the panelists agreed on one thing – that a business would be more profitable if it made its reach multilingual. But building a business or app in India in an Indian language just doesn’t garner the kind of attention it does if the same is built in English – this is something that needs to change, the panelists said. There is a need for data in India to be controlled by the Indian people and made available in Indian languages, one of the panelists, Ankush Sachdeva, Co-founder and CEO of ShareChat said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Video Is Language-Agnostic’&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a fireside chat with Google India Vice President Rajan Anandan, Raghav Bahl, Founder of Quintillion Media spoke about how to democratise the internet in a country as multilingual as India. One way to do that, Anandan said, is through the platform of online video as the platform is inherently language-agnostic. This helps solve one of the most serious challenges in content creation in different languages. “Over 95 percent of content consumed on YouTube is not in English,” he said. People’s ease in understanding spoken words, rather than having to read complex sentences, is another benefit that video offers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anandan also estimated here that the Indian language advertising market would reach Rs 6,000 crore by 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘English-Speakers a Microscopic Minority in India’&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking at the event, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari stressed the importance of regional languages and called English-speakers and English news consumers a “microscopic minority in India”.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Talking about &amp;nbsp;PM Modi’s ‘Make in India’ policy, he posed a question: ‘If India can make satellites, why can’t it manufacture mobile phones?’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Make Indian Languages More Profitable&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a panel discussion on how to make Indian languages more profitable, the panelists spoke about how Hindi and other regional language-speaking mediums and businesses don’t seem to take themselves seriously.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They opined that in terms of brands, campaigns and technology, Hindi and other Indian languages can do so much more, but they need to put in the effort. The largest advertisers have English websites, and local language advertisers themselves feel that their experience for the user is broken unless it is in English. Advertisers need to have more faith in the local inventory, the panellists said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What the panellists all agreed on was that advertisers need to get on board with the Indian language content, because language is at a premium.</news:description>

      <news:title>Mondelez India launches new Bournvita for women</news:title>
      <news:description>After making Cadbury Bournvita a household name for 70 years in India, Mondelez India today announced its foray into the growing adult health MFD (malt food drinks) segment with its new premium innovation - Bournvita for Women. This made-in-India innovation has been created to address the needs of the health conscious modern Indian woman, and is fortified with essential nutrients. The core benefit story for the brand is that the consumption of 2 cups of BV Women fulfils the RDA (Recommended Dietary allowance) of Calcium &amp;amp; Vitamin D for bone strength and of Iron &amp;amp; Folic acid to reduce fatigue for women, and it has no added sugar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inderpreet Singh, Associate Director – Marketing (Gum, Candy and Powdered Beverages), Mondelez India, said, “Hectic schedules and fast-paced lifestyles often result in women missing out on meeting their daily nutritional requirements. At the same time, modern-day women are increasingly becoming more aware of issues surrounding health and wellness. As a brand, Bournvita has always focused on the proposition of bringing out the inner strength, and with Bournvita for Women, we are extending the same philosophy to new-age women by providing specialized nutrition with no added sugar. Focusing on our benefit story, our communication will highlight how Bournvita for Women will help a woman fulfil her day’s nutritional needs related to &lt;br&gt;strong bones and reduction of fatigue. We are very excited about Bournvita for Women’s  journey in India.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indian consumers have trusted the wholesome goodness of Cadbury Bournvita for close to 70 years, and the launch of Bournvita for Women is aligned with the company’s plans to constantly innovate to meet the evolving needs of consumers as they move towards healthier lifestyles. Bournvita for Women highlights the company’s commitment to improving the nutrition and ingredient profile of its brands as changing lifestyles &amp;amp; rising awareness around Health and Wellness continue to influence consumer food choices. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The product launch will be supported by a high decibel integrated marketing campaign and a disruptive visibility strategy in modern and traditional trade stores. Bournvita for Women is available across all major urban and rural retailers from September 2018. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Known for rolling out award-winning progressive and iconic advertisements that remain in the minds of consumers, Cadbury Bournvita along with Ogilvy &amp;amp; Mather has come out with a path-breaking and inspiring film for its new launch -  Bournvita for Women. The film opens to a family conversation over the dining table, where  the husband suggests selling off the old dilapidated van of his grandfather. The woman of the house almost instantly offers to buy the van. Thereafter, the film shows her working day-in and day-out to fix a van that nobody thought she would be able to do. She takes charge, attempting to single-handedly repair &amp;amp; build something out of the van, showcasing her inner strength; and bravo, she converts this van into a full-fledged food truck. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The film is supported by an equally powerful background score that promises to take the viewers on an inspiring and motivational journey of inner strength in just 40 seconds; the TVC ends with the introduction of the new product.&lt;br&gt;See the video:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>India's Golden Girl, Sprinter Hima Das Joins Adidas</news:title>
      <news:description>Eighteen year old Hima Das is the first Indian woman athlete to win a gold at a global track event. adidas today welcomed the young athletics sensation into the adidas family. Das, already a big fan of adidas (she wore adidas sprint spikes in her historic run at the Youth Championships and at the Asian Games) will now be equipped with the very best offerings from adidas for her racing and training needs, as she continues her journey to becoming the best sprinter in the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Popularly being referred to as ‘Golden Girl’ and ‘Dhing Express’, Das has made history by becoming the first Indian athlete to win a gold medal at the world level. Das, a tenacious and perseverant teenager, won&amp;nbsp;gold medal at a global track event when she won the women’s 400m at the IAAF World Under-20 Championships in Finland, followed by three podiums at the recently concluded Asian Games in Indonesia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the announcement of the association, adidas India Managing Director, Dave Thomas presented Das with an Adizero Prime SP, one of adidas’ most premium and technical sprinting shoes. The personalised shoe features the sprinter’s name ‘HIMA DAS’ on the right shoe and ‘CREATE HISTORY’ on the left shoe.      &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“At adidas we believe that ‘through sport, we have the power to change lives’ and Hima is a great example of this. Many of our associations and partnerships are focused on empowering youth in India and making a positive change. We at adidas also believe that as the leading sports brand in India it is important to encourage girls to take up sport and keep playing sport as they get older. Over the last couple of years, Hima and many other Indian women have emerged as torchbearers with their outstanding performances. adidas is very keen to support India’s youth and to build a stronger sporting spirit and ambition in them,” said Thomas.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also present at the announcement was Sean Van Wyk, Senior Marketing Director, adidas India who said, “Hima is an inspiration not just for women and girls, but for the entire country and we take pride in having her join team adidas. She has created history and we shall help her in her journey to maximize her potential and become the best in the world. On this journey with her, we shall, together, inspire today’s youth to take to sports and create a positive change in and around their lives.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delighted about her relationship with adidas, Das said, “I have always aspired to wear adidas shoes. In fact, I have been wearing them for the last few years and was wearing them during the Youth Championships and the Asian Games. I feel extremely proud to join the adidas family and be a part of a great group of global athletes. adidas has an incredible track record for helping athletes across sports and enabling them to reach the peak of their sport. With them, I hope to take my performances to the next level on the field, and also help create change off it. Our aim together is to improve participation of Indian youth in sports and women empowerment and I am confident of creating the change with adidas.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the last decade, adidas has been working with many young athletes and investing in grassroot initiatives to empower young athletes to take to sports. Some of the grassroot investments include the adidas Runners community, the Tango league and adidas Base for football, and adidas Junior Open in tennis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indian athletes such as Rohit Sharma, Kuldeep Yadav, Rishabh Pant, Dipika Pallikal, Zeel Desai, Nikhat Zareen, Siddhanth Banthia, Manjot Kalra, along with international athletes like Lionel Messi, Paul Pogba, Naomi Osaka, Caroline Wozniacki, Wayde van Niekerk and Gladys Cherono among others wear the 3-Stripes with pride.</news:description>

      <news:title>The headcount of Ogilvy is the headcount of Ogilvy digital: Namrata Keswani</news:title>
      <news:description>“The headcount of Ogilvy is the headcount of Ogilvy digital,” Namrata Keswani announces in response to a question on the size of Ogilvy’s digital team. Keswani heads the digital domain for Ogilvy Mumbai. It is remarkable for an agency that is rooted in traditional advertising to embrace digital the way Ogilvy is doing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Digital is a way of thinking rather than a separate silo offering that a client comes to us for,” she says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital now runs in the DNA of Ogilvy. Every client that comes on board to work with Ogilvy can reap the benefits of having a team that is not just an expert in traditional mainline advertising but has a solid digital outlook as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How did Ogilvy get here? The year-long refounding of Ogilvy that culminated in the breaking down of silos and simplifying of&amp;nbsp;solutions has made this possible. “The entire agency is one compact ecosystem. We have six clear offerings now: brand strategy, advertising, customer engagement &amp;amp; commerce, PR &amp;amp; influence, digital transformation, and partnerships. Digital runs through all these offerings. Instead of digital operating in a silo like earlier, digital is part of all brands,” says Keswani. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ogilvy’s Digital Approach &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explaining how the teams now function, Keswani says, “We put the brand solution out first. Then, across all the offerings in our bouquet, be it advertising, consulting, PR, or strategy, we supply digital on everything.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Keswani, making digital a part of everything that Ogilvy does for its clients is a “fantastic change” because “it gives the client a very rounded point of view of what they should do on their brand” and “it is a sign of living digital.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;George Kovoor, group&amp;nbsp;creative director&amp;nbsp;behind Ogilvy Mumbai, tells us that many partnerships that began in the mainline domain have turned into integrated partnerships. This evolution stems from the understanding that digital is not just a social media post. “The area that we at Ogilvy are exploring is the world of digital beyond social media and viral posts. Whether it is consumer engagement or splicing of data to address different customers differently, etc.,” says Burzin Mehta, the third digital domain expert and Group Creative Director at Ogilvy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to helping clients with their digital journeys, Ogilvy itself is undergoing a massive digital transformation. Last year, Ogilvy launched an exclusive consulting arm headed by Sonia Khurana to advise clients on all things digital and data. In addition, the agency is also adding several other technology-led capabilities like UI/UX, website development, empaneling with vendors who can create technology - VR, apps, chatbots etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Training Talent in Digital &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over and above all of this, Ogilvy India is striking industry-level partnerships to upskill talent and think digital first. The Google-Ogilvy Creative Intelligence Partnership is one such. “We are trying to upskill every single person in this office so that everyone is holding a conversation on digital with clients with a certain degree of comfort. We are teaching them how a TV campaign can be leveraged best on YouTube, training them on understanding the platforms, how data analytics works,” explains Keswani. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Google-Ogilvy Creative Intelligence Partnership is a first-of-its-kind and a one- of-its-kind partnership between an agency and a tech company. As part of this new initiative, Ogilvy and Google are “creating customised learning paths for all of Ogilvy to see what we can train them on. The research and analysis for that is on currently,” Keswani says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There is no escaping digital in client conversations. Everyone in this office is slowly getting empowered with digital. That’s the journey we have embarked upon. There’s a long way to go,” she says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kovoor says that clients who left the Ogilvy fold to work with native digital agencies are now returning to work with Ogilvy because the agency is a master of the two main components of great advertising - storytelling and brand understanding. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ogilvy, which has always had in-house production capabilities, looks to hire people with multiple skills and talents so that they can do some video editing, sound editing beyond their script-writing and art direction work. This helps the agency churn work that does not need very high production quality on a regular basis for clients who constantly need to stay engaged with consumers. Weighing in on the trend of digital agencies launching content studios, the trio said that to stay agile and meet the demands of clients who need hundreds of pieces of content during a year in addition to the three-four standout pieces of content, it makes most sense for agencies to bring a part of that work in-house. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing Digital Appetite Among Clients &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last time this reporter sat down with Keswani and Kovoor, the duo were proudly showcasing their latest tech innovation - a VR experience for commercial trucks for Tata Motors. Innovations like those take months if not a year in some cases, Keswani says. “The thing with tech innovations is that it takes a lot of time and effort to roll out. It takes a lot of patience, deliberation from the team and client,” she says. Her team is working on four more such long-term tech innovation projects that will come to fruition over the next six months. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not just that, it also takes a fair amount of time and effort to convince the client about an unconventional idea. “In the case of Tata Motors for example, you are asking a client to suspend his belief that test drives can only be test drives. That takes convincing of management at both ends, identifying the right partners, taking into account budget realities and on-ground realities and then the obsession that Ogilvy has to get it right - that takes time as well,” says Keswani. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kovoor says clients now are more open to these budget-intensive and time-intensive projects. “When I started in digital, the idea among clients was that it should be instant and it should be free! That has changed completely,” he says. “It is a fantastic change in mindset that we are seeing now. This was not there last year.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kovoor adds, “Clients who would be willing to spend a crore on a mainline project would fall off their chair if an agency proposed Rs 10 lakh for a digital project. Now I see clients are willing to spend Rs 50-80 lakh on a digital project.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If there is anything that holds clients back from spending, it is the lack of a complete understanding of the scope of digital. Mehta says one of the reasons digital has not received the kind of funding that TV does from clients is because most people underestimate how India has digitally exploded.</news:description>

Mahendra Soni, Director and Co-Founder, hoichoi explained, “With almost 40 per cent of our audience coming from non-urban areas, we decided to emulate the successful telecom model and introduce Hoichoi Top Up cards to make it convenient for our customers to subscribe to Hoichoi.

      <news:description>Happy mcgarrybowen, the award winning creative agency from Dentsu Aegis Network, has been awarded the integrated mainline and digital communications duties for XSEED Education. With an aim to spread the brand’s footprint across the country, the business will be handled out of Happy mcgarrybowen’s Bangalore office.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;XSEED Education is a Singapore based social enterprise. Founded by Ashish Rajpal in 2008, The K-8 learning company runs a proven, research-based academic program for schools that build thinking skills &amp;amp; problem-solving confidence in children. Over one million children from more than 3,000 schools across India, Nepal, Bhutan, the Middle East and the Philippines currently benefit from the XSEED method of education. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the development,  Kartik Iyer, CEO, Happy mcgarrybowen said, “It is very inspiring to see what XSEED is doing to education in the country.

What's more, the fact that XSEED is being taken to schools across middle-income India is really a sign of great things to come for the children of our country."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the partnership, Ashish Rajpal, Founder, XSEED said, "XSEED's mission is to help realise the innate potential of every child. To do so, it is essential to transform elementary education from rote &amp;amp; memorisation to a genuine ability to learn over a lifetime, beyond the elite, for children across the economic strata. Not only do we need to transform every dimension of the education eco-system-curriculum, teaching, assessment - at an affordable cost. The idea is also to build a powerful brand that parents recognise and trust. We believe our partnership with Happy mcgarrybowen will add significant firepower to that effort.”</news:description>

      <news:title>Aaj Tak announces brand campaign ‘Saare Jahaan Se Sachcha’</news:title>
      <news:description>Hindi language news channel, Aaj Tak, has been one of the leaders for 17 years since inception. A feat Aaj Tak accomplished because its singular focus on the most important stakeholder, the viewer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Time and again all major news events have proven that Aaj Tak operates in the trust zone, that very few news brands have occupied. The campaign idea ‘Saare Jahaan Se Sachcha’ draws from what has been the core of Aaj Tak – Fearlessness, Truth and No Compromise. It highlights one of the fundamental needs in the society - to be honest and to be true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign aims to bring forth the founding principles of Truth &amp;amp; Integrity that have defined the Aaj Tak newsroom for 17 years. Instead of focusing on ‘what’ truth does, the campaign focuses on ‘why’ truth is so important. Why it’s so important to have brands like Aaj Tak – which carry the flag of truth amid unsubstantiated noise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign is led by 3 TVCs that capture everyday situations in which a common man is duped with the web of lies, when there is no accountability, and no action to put an end to this situation. Each narrative is a hard hitting reality check on the kind of day to day transactions we see all around us. The campaign line – Saare Jahaan Se Sachcha has been thoughtfully conceived to tug at people’s hearts. It re-affirms and connects the positive emotion of India’s iconic song ‘Saare Jahaan Se achchha’ with Brand Aaj Tak, lending it the stature and scale it deserves.</news:description>

      <news:title>Brands need to demonstrate how they are open more than ever: Nick Foley, Landor</news:title>
      <news:description>exchange4media recently caught up with Nick Foley, President of Landor Southeast Asia Pacific &amp;amp; Japan, when the regional head was in India on work. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A marketer in his previous avatar and an agency man now, Foley is uniquely poised to understand and navigate the agency world given his experience of working at Mars and Nestle. Debunking the myth that pricing is the main factor for deciding which agency wins an account, he said, “rarely in my 15 years of working in marketing, did I make a decision based on price.” He says it is tedious for brands to actually&amp;nbsp;sit through multiple pitches and therefore it makes far more sense to have long-term partnerships. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a freewheeling chat, Foley shared insights on the world of branding, how it is evolving, why agencies must say no to giving away their creative intellect, and why he thinks brands should listen to their social media communities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edited Excerpts: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You recently said that marketers need to be more clued into their “communities”, who have become an “influencing party” rather than acting as “cops” who fiercely guard a brand’s every asset.&amp;nbsp;Can you explain this view of yours? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;What we have seen, particularly since the rise of social media,&amp;nbsp;is that it is much easier for consumers to have a say now. When I first started out in marketing in 1993, if somebody was not happy with your brand or what you were doing, there weren't too many options for what they could do about it. But today, if consumers are not happy, there are a lot of social media platforms where they can share their opinions. It's much more two-way now. So marketers need to think about influencing that opinion and engaging the communities. Millennials have now become the largest segment of the consumer group, and for them, everything is about interaction and being able to co-create. Brands need to demonstrate how they are open more than ever to the influence of others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can brands tap into their communities to create engagement?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you look at the events of the last week, see what Nike has done with the Colin Kaepernick campaign. It is a brand that has always been quite a renegade and has always been trying things that other brands have been too afraid to. They clearly realise that sponsoring a controversial athlete would be appealing, and of course they've been able to amplify that beautifully through social media channels. What could have been just another marketing story in a week became the marketing story of the week because the President of the United States decided to weigh in on it. They've understood well what the community really wants and have a sense of what somebody is doing within a community and they've responded to that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So there are examples of brands quickly understanding how their communities want them to pivot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signing on Colin Kaepernick is a risky choice, but most often we see brands playing it safe...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think some brands play safe because there are so many areas where they can be exposed. I think an interesting example right now of a brand playing it safe, and they probably wish they haven't, is in Singapore. There is a lovely movie which has been released, Crazy, Rich Asians. The movie is based on a book. In the book, the key character flies out from New York to Singapore on Singapore Airlines, and talks about the experience of being in the first class, etc. But in the movie, that particular scene depicts another brand. It was a very good movie to be associated with because of the publicity it would have brought. Among all the brands (mentioned in the book), the only one&amp;nbsp;that didn't appear in the movie was Singapore Airlines. And that, to me, is a brand playing it very safe. The movie reflects brilliantly on Singapore and so a number of brands were ready to be part of the movie. But maybe Singapore Airlines thought some of their passengers might take 'Crazy, Rich Asians' the wrong way. But actually no, they probably wished they got on. Because the publicity created was so positive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Colin Kaepernick ad by Nike was also political in nature. Can brands take a political stand? What do they stand to gain or lose, and how much of it is a calculated move that they need to make? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most of the time I would advise against doing it. Leave the politics to political parties. It can be very divisive. But yes, it has to be very calculated, and normally, it would be betting on the fact that you would have a younger demographic that would be more engaged with the brand because of it. It's risky. It works, but it would be something that I would use occasionally.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the main building block for a brand? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brands need to have a clear idea of their brand purpose. What is the purpose of things your brand is associated with? Creating brands is at the heart of what Landor does. Brand positioning is understanding the desire of creating a position in the minds of your target audience. For example, for the year, Nike's brand idea is ‘winning’, and everything we've seen, ties into that. If you don't have a strong idea that your brand stands for, then that's only going to create confusion, particularly with your target audience. I still believe that great brands are guided by a single-minded idea. Everything else is executional and should revolve around that brand idea.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The advertising business is under threat from management consultancies, how are design and branding agencies remaining relevant to brands during this period of churn?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Management consultancies basically come down to reducing the cost within a business. They are coming from accounting and moving more towards consulting. But the way creative agencies approach a brand is about how we feel and how the consumer feels. Branding is most impactful when you try to influence things from an emotional perspective rather than from a functional perspective. There is a quote: “the difference between function and emotion is that function leads to a conclusion, whereas emotion leads to action”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are three roles of a brand: first is to help a company build a foundation, second is premiumisation and the third is very occasionally salvation, so that if something goes wrong, the brand can help you get back up. So let's not delude ourselves, most of the reasons why anyone even&#13;
bothers to have a brand is so you can change the appropriate premium and very&#13;
rarely can you get to that premium through having some sort of functional&#13;
advantage, it needs to be emotional.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But are brands thinking like this? Because they do seem to want to reduce cost...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cost reduction is part of business, but it's “fool's gold”. You can reduce costs to zero, but you can grow revenue infinitely. If I was thinking about a strategy of innovation, renovation and growth, then brands pivot to that want to look at how to take cost out. Then there's a role for that, but it's a bit of a slippery slope.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you tell us, from the perspective of branding, what kind of technologies are you looking at to improve branding?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We've shifted from the time of it being about the relationship with the brand and the promise of the brand to it being more about brand experience. Digital is an all-encompassing word. Hand-held mobile devices can now do much more experiential than what it has been in the past. So we need to understand what the customer journey is and the points within that where the brand can be amplified in a manner which is probably disproportionate to other touch-points. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brand experience is very important and digital mechanisms such as apps, websites or trackers can be a way to help you get closer to your target audience. But as far as the question of why people engage with brands is concerned, the reason hasn't changed much-- Is the brand relevant? Is it different from anything else in the market? Do I have respect for the brand? And most importantly, is the brand something I can trust? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which are some brands that you think are doing it right when it comes to use of technology?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amazon is pretty amazing. Amazon web services are changing the fundamentals of retail very quickly. Google is also amazing. Uniqlo is doing a really good job as far as online-offline retail goes. Also Coca-Cola; so far that you don't need cash to get their products (cashless vending machine). So that's a fundamental change for them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You've been on the client's side, what are some of the learnings from there that you apply now?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Responsiveness is critical and it astounds me when I see people from the agency side not getting back to a client within less than 24 hours. Partnerships are so important. People think clients will easily swap out on agencies. They can, but the client has to get to know another agency and build the trust again. I think, we do not place enough emphasis on long-term partnerships from the agency side. Typically, you hear that's it's all price-driven, but rarely in my 15 years of working in marketing, did I make a decision based on price. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The best way to approach pitches is to talk to a number of agencies and get a sense of their approach to the problem. Don’t ask them to solve the whole problem as a demonstration. That’s just ripping people off. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The relationship between clients and agencies is sometimes very project based, your thoughts... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do think it is good that it is becoming project driven. One of my frustrations with the retainer model, particularly for advertising agencies, is that while there might be a month when the agency is busy and churning out a lot of work, there also might be periods when the client feels that the agency is not very busy. Whereas in the project model, there is much less room for either party to have any discontentment. But does that impact the idea and the story of the brand? I would argue no. As long as my idea and brand purpose is clear, the rest is execution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transcription Credit: Sudha Joshi&lt;/em&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>TAM ad volume data shows 18% growth on TV in first six months of 2018</news:title>
      <news:description>TAM Media Research has released an ad volume&amp;nbsp;data for the period of January-June&amp;nbsp;2017 to January-June 2018. It&amp;nbsp;says that ad volume&amp;nbsp;on television has increased by 18 per&amp;nbsp;cent from last year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The figures represent the combined indexed growth of the top 10&amp;nbsp;categories of the period January-June 2018. The top 10&amp;nbsp;categories of the current year (January-June 2018) includes toilet soaps&amp;nbsp;leading the category,&amp;nbsp;followed by B2C online shopping, toothpastes, two wheelers, washing powders, shampoos, general Internet service, toilet cleaners, cellular phone&amp;nbsp;service and DTH service providers.   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rohit Gupta, President, Network Sales&amp;nbsp;and International Business, Sony Pictures Networks,&amp;nbsp;believes that the year has been good so far for television. “The last two years, industry was affected by demonetisation and GST. This year has been pretty clean. Television spends are back and big properties such as&amp;nbsp;IPL, FIFA, KBC and&amp;nbsp;Indian Idol&amp;nbsp;are all fully sold out. The business is looking good. Television is the key medium for any advertiser&amp;nbsp;and now money has started flowing&amp;nbsp;back to it. We have seen growth across all categories,” he said while giving a perspective from both GEC and sports channels.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of infotainment,&amp;nbsp;Vikram Tanna, Head of Advertising Sales &amp;amp; Business, Head of Regional Clusters, South Asia, at Discovery Networks Asia-Pacific, said, “If we look at the last six months, we have seen lots of positive momentum being built across clients and key categories and strong positive momentum is giving results to&amp;nbsp;advertisers and now they are investing more and more in TV. We are actually looking at a&amp;nbsp;festive blockbuster. If you look at our network, we have invested disproportionately also in terms of IPs coming across Discovery, Animal Planet and TLC. If you look at the brands, they are largely dependent on television, there is an affinity as&amp;nbsp;television offers you just about&amp;nbsp;anything. It creates&amp;nbsp;relevant content and advertisers are always looking for reach as well as&amp;nbsp;affinity.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sujata Dwibedy, Executive Vice President, Carat India, Dentsu Aegis Network, explained that every agency forecasts this data but you have to discount the spends for a more precise&amp;nbsp;projection. "Instead of absolute ad spends, what we look at is&amp;nbsp;the spends of last year, so as per that, what we have seen is while till 2015 there was a growth of 12 per&amp;nbsp;cent on TV spends, 2016 has been 10.5 per&amp;nbsp;cent, 2017 saw a&amp;nbsp;growth of 8.3 per&amp;nbsp;cent&amp;nbsp;and in 2018 we are expecting it to end at&amp;nbsp;about 10 per cent growth. Your overall advertising spend is growing at 9 or 10 per&amp;nbsp;cent out of which&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;41 per&amp;nbsp;cent is TV and 30-35 per&amp;nbsp;cent is print and balance is&amp;nbsp;other media.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Echoing&amp;nbsp;similar thoughts,&amp;nbsp;Vidhu Sagar, National Director - PointNine Lintas at MullenLowe Lintas Group, explained that typically at the agency level, there are the reported numbers that come&amp;nbsp;when you run the software and then you apply what is called ‘discounted factor’ to bring it to the real numbers. "Essentially the ways&amp;nbsp;used for estimating spends by TAM could be called card rates. We try to bring spends down by using typically ‘discounting factors'," he said.&lt;br&gt;“Overall projection for the year for the industry as a whole has been&amp;nbsp;8-12 per&amp;nbsp;cent. Within the television industry, projections have been driven by consideration of IPL&amp;nbsp;and it being&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp; election year so certainly, the television industry has grown," he added.</news:description>

      <news:title>India will soon become world’s first voice-driven Internet market: Rajan Anandan</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;India, home to more than a thousand regional languages, today thrives as one of the largest English speaking countries in the world. However, this growth of English language has led to concerns that India’s own languages shouldn’t die. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a&amp;nbsp;fireside chat held in Delhi&amp;nbsp;between Raghav Bahl, Founder, Quintillion Media'&amp;nbsp;and Rajan Anandan, VP, South East Asia &amp;amp; India, discussion&amp;nbsp;was held on&amp;nbsp;the role of technology in building an India-specific Internet that is efficient enough to serve the multi-linguistic country was an event in Delhi that hosted a&amp;nbsp;fireside &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The chat commenced with Raghav Bahl raising some pertinent questions on whether it is fair enough to compare the Indian market, which is so linguistically diverse, with countries like Japan, Korea &amp;amp; China that are mainly monolithic in terms of language. The Chinese market has 500 million people who speak the same language, but India has 400 million who speak at least 20 different languages. Looking for ways to resolve this contradiction, Bahl questioned Anandan if building an Internet that’s specific to each language spoken in India is a solution?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anandan replied with a yes. He said, “This way, one can find both challenges and opportunity to co-exist as we work towards accomplishing an Internet catering to India’s diversity.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anandan pointed out that platforms like YouTube could act as an interesting proxy&amp;nbsp;for what one could do with Internet in India. YouTube has a reach of 250 million users and a video platform as large as this represents almost all languages. “This helps to create content must faster and in varied languages for a wider audience. Today, construct of videos has successfully overcome some of the major challenges in content creation, like that of accessibility,” said Anandan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Acknowledging Anandan’s thoughts on videos, Bahl stressed on how the platform today had the ability to be language agnostic and thereby lead to democratisation of content, creativity &amp;amp; production. Drawing a parallel, Bahl referred to the world of television of the mid 90s. He explained how viewers &amp;amp; producers were only aware of a handful of channels both in Hindi &amp;amp; English then. But 10 years down the lane, the story seems to have evolved, with the regional market emerging successfully. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Discussing the role of Indian government in this scenario, Bahl said, “We are not looking for government funding and policies. Our only expectation from the government is to act as a regulatory framework.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Throwing light on some key measures for companies to invest in and become an Indian Internet company, Anandan said it was crucial for a brand to tailor its content, product and services in multiple languages so as to be national and offer a seamless experience to all its users. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He added, “As an eco-system, we are already in the process of building the Indian Internet that will cater to multilingualism in India.” However, Anandan also believes in the concept of building large flourishing businesses based on one language over time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Referring to the recent launch of a set of voice features on Google Go at the 4th edition of Google for India event, Anandan said, “Voice in the Indian Internet is exploding as users today seem too keen in talking to the Internet instead of tapping or typing.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking at figures denoting the explosive growth in the&amp;nbsp;voice segment, Anandan claimed that India would soon become the world’s first voice-driven Internet market, where voice will be both the primary input &amp;amp; output. Anandan opined that voice in Indian languages combined with video would be the new Internet product in India. This will be a concept very different from what has been built so far in the West, US or China. India’s language diversity will be the sole driving factor behind this innovation, he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Google statistics, the online advertising market in Indian languages will hit the Rs 6,000-cr mark by 2020. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about content consumption, Anandan said 95 per cent of all content consumed by Indians on YouTube is not in English. Not only this, but also the language is of negligible significance while discerning online video monetisation figures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about maintaining parity in distributing content among publishers in the advertising industry, Bahl pointed out that Google and Facebook consume almost 90 per cent of the online advertising revenue. He said that there’s a need for large platforms to find ways to ensure that their partnership with publishers is more equitable in terms of shares. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Responding to this, Anandan said, “Interestingly, in the last two years, the combined share has gone down. But publishers who have the right content for valuable audiences are able to generate reasonable revenue even today. For us to have a thriving open Internet in India, everyone needs to participate. Hence, we are working closely with quite a few publishers &amp;amp; not just few selected ones.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having said that, Anandan also indicated that the business model of publishers shouldn’t only be ads. It should also include subscriptions, referrals, driving commerce etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the economics of digital publishing, Bahl said revenues would come to digital publishers in due course of time. He said, “Cost structure of a digital publisher is very different from that of a television broadcaster. Nearly 50 per cent of television broadcasting cost is either spent on distribution or on media infrastructure. While distribution &amp;amp; infrastructure cost is almost zero in the digital world compared to TV or newspapers, there isn’t a high degree of conversation between the distributor &amp;amp; publisher in the digital space.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Toward the end of the session organised at the launch of&amp;nbsp;Bol: Love Your Bhasha, an initiative of Quint Hindi and Google India,&amp;nbsp;Anandan spoke about distribution in digital publishing. He shared his thoughts on how the use of mobile web &amp;amp; apps together has created something that the content industry had never witnessed before. “The idea here is different on quite a few measures, some of which include the cost structure; the ability to reach the customer, content as well as the distribution measures,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>35% of our viewers come from tier 2 and tier 3 towns: Vijay Subramaniam, Amazon Prime</news:title>
      <news:description>Video steaming platforms are fast changing the way content is getting consumed. The new high in content driven entertainment, spearheaded by players like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, have forced traditional players to up their game. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interview with exchange4media, Vijay Subramaniam, Director &amp;amp; Head, Content, Amazon Prime Video India spoke about the rise of video streaming platforms in India and how Amazon Prime Video is looking to tap the vast market potential shaped by low cost data and hyper proliferation of smartphones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How would you describe the video streaming market in India?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think we are just about to get started. India is a huge country and there are several opportunities. What is exciting is that it is never one India; it is so many different India’s. There are opportunities and creative challenges to tell stories that appeal to all of them and various segments within them. So I think this journey has just begun. I would say that the next five years are going to be super exciting for customers overall as they get access to stories that did not have any place to be told earlier.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A lot of new players have entered the video on demand space in big way, how do you plan to stay ahead in this competition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As I said it is a really vast place. I think it's really important to understand how we look at driving value for our customers. Everything that we do, we start with the customer in mind. It is very important for us to understand the existing tastes and preferences when it comes to entertainment, as well as stay lockstep as those tastes and preferences evolve. So we are really guided by how we are doing the best we can in fulfilling the entertainment needs of our customers. Given how diverse the country is, and given the great opportunities to tell stories, it is a vast runway ahead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of an evaluation process do you follow at Amazon Prime before embarking on new projects?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our evaluation process is very rigorous and an elaborate one. The important thing is that it is driven by the existing tastes and preferences of customers that we are looking to fulfill. So, our selection criteria are very rigorous, both on the creative side, as well as from an insight and strategy side. Variety is critical and we believe it is important to look at genres that matter. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Moreover, we are always looking at what need is it fulfilling, which entertainment hook is it attempting to anchor itself on and how is it creating value to what we are doing overall. So these are all the things that we go through thoroughly. It is a lot of fun, though it may sound very clinical, because it is also a creative process and you are building something from scratch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has the number game been for you so far?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are very happy with where we are. I must admit that the Prime membership program, Prime Video being part of it, has seen robust growth. We have seen a growth of 3X in numbers, interestingly, 35 per cent of our viewers come from tier 2 and tier 3 towns and that is another interesting fact right there. As I said, there are many India's that we are catering to, and it is really important to be able to reflect their tastes and preferences when it comes to entertainment, as well as we can, and keep evolving with it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also know that it is absolutely essential to consistently deliver value to them and that's what the Prime membership program attempts to do. We believe we are in it for the long run and there is a massive opportunity here. Last year we launched one show, this year we are going to six, next year we hope to be at 10 and then at 12 and keep building on that. This gives a clear indication of the kind of ambition we have to be able to serve our customers here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your strategy for regional space?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Localisation is very important for us. If you look at our content, we are available in five regional languages. There is Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and Marathi, that itself is a very strong indicator of how committed we are about making sure that we are able to serve the length and breadth of customers in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also recognise that no two customers of ours are alike and so it is important to provide variety. Local relevance is important for us because it drives deeper engagement and an emotional connect with customers. So our path to regional content has always been very clear. It is just that we go about building it in a very thorough manner and you will see us continue to expand as we add more languages to the content mix.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your view, what are the biggest challenges for video streaming players in India?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I will speak for Prime video; all these are very positive challenges that we have. The first one is the creative challenge, I mean there are so many stories, which ones do you pick and which ones do you build on, and that's such a wonderful creative challenge. The second is really within the content ecosystem, the infrastructure. It needs to come to a global standard very quickly, I am not saying it does not exist, but it may not be as consistent. The third challenge is about understanding that when it comes to great stories, the battle is won and lost in the writing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The general perception is that online streaming platforms have brought back focus on great content and have rattled mainstream entertainment players, is that the case in real?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don't think so. I can't speak for others and how they react to a creative challenge but I do emphasise on how inspiring it has become for creators. What it has allowed them is to raise the bar. If they were finding other mediums limiting, what we have managed to do is to liberate them from those limitations. If there is a story that is deep and dense and needs to be told in 10 hours, creators have the liberty to do that with us. If the story is nuanced, is layered and requires a deep investment, again Prime Video allows you to do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Streaming platforms have given content creators a very healthy creative challenge. I see two winners here - the customer and the creator. If you are willing to take the challenge, ultimately you are telling better stories to customers and they are going to appreciate you for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internationally large studios are being taken over by streaming platforms, do you see that phenomenon happening in India anytime soon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India is a very unique country; I really don't have the expertise to comment on how the industry will move because the studios would have a much deeper understanding of that. However, I do believe that a lot of studios are already ahead in this game in India. They are already looking at this as a great opportunity to tell better stories. I think studios will wrap their hands around the opportunities to put out premium cinematic content and that will actually create a new revenue model for them.</news:description>

      <news:title>Changing media landscape in rapidly evolving digital world: Deepak Lamba, Worldwide Media</news:title>
      <news:description>The media landscape as we know it today would have been unfathomable and unimaginable only&amp;nbsp;a decade ago. To establish a sense of timeline, it was only around 2004-2005 that some of today’s prominent digital platforms came into being. It was less than 10 years ago that streaming services, apps and a more evolved digital world emerged. While multiple digital trends picked up over the past few years, web search has been an indispensable part of the internet since it was introduced in 1995. In that respect, Google search continues to dominate the digital space with evolved features and detailed information in various formats that is specific to the search pattern of the user on different devices and platforms. Today, the comprehensive digital evolution, inclusive of the advancements in web search, has brought about a paradigm shift in the way the media and entertainment industry operates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The unprecedented scale of digital evolution can be put in perspective through the number of internet users in the country, which was estimated to reach 500 million in June 2018 from 481 million in December 2017, as per the IAMAI-Kantar IMRB 2017 Report. The unparalleled growth comes at the back of extensive broadband penetration, affordable smartphones and data costs, higher purchasing power of the people as well as cohesive technological advancements, among other factors. What continue to propel the domain are notable trends, and the coming year will bear host to some of the most exciting developments in the space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Content Marketing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The growing prominence of videos, with a platform such as YouTube, has given rise to an alternative era of sorts. Today, no promotional activity or media plan for any business is complete without content distribution through videos. Brands and businesses have begun to deliver short-form videos encapsulating high-quality original content to captivate their audiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trend can be attributed to the millennials’ preference for videos, and its strength can be estimated by the fact that social media giant Facebook is also slowly and steadily transforming to promote video consumption on its platform. It has also given birth to branded video content by production houses and content creation&amp;nbsp;for the purpose of providing effective visibility to the stakeholders while enhancing their reach on the digital medium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, a single platform becoming a hub of content and a single conglomerate influencing and controlling the optimisation of content online is a cause of concern. Whether it is for films, serials or short-form specialised content in India, there is a need to ensure that consolidation of the distribution channels doesn’t come at a cost of an uneven playing field for content creators.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changing Face of Television&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;With more and more audience turning to the digital medium, broadcasters have also taken the necessary measures to adapt to the evolving content consumption pattern. Many leading broadcasters in the country have their own apps, where anyone with a smartphone can view content that was otherwise primarily only telecast. Alternately, there are apps that offer the whole range of channels akin to the television. I anticipate the coming year bringing more of similar TV apps with a host of features from varied players in the broadcasting space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, as a country with over 1.3 billion people, there is still a significant amount of population relying on traditional media. As also, the digital-first audience is also known to turn to print, television and other traditional mediums. So, the media and entertainment (M&amp;amp;E) industry has to cut a fine balance in redefining its presence in the sector.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ecommerce Integration&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Ecommerce has also largely contributed to the digital boom. With the competitive nature of the industry, a level playing field has been created which&amp;nbsp;benefits the consumers at large. Ecommerce further serves as a comprehensive platform for advertisers to gather in-depth knowledge of consumer preferences. It enables them to feature relevant advertisements on the web and reach out to the target set from the large pool of consumers. Ecommerce has impacted the way sales and marketing activities are carried out; case-in-point being the recent possible Flipkart and Hotstar tie-up. Consumers are being made aware about products or even services through captivating branded content. So, a symbiotic relationship has emerged between media houses producing good content and mammoth online marketplaces such as Amazon and Flipkart. With swift technological advancements, we see ecommerce portals, marketers and content producers at large, giving a good look at how consumer interactions also evolve within the digital framework.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Augmented Reality (AR)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We have already witnessed AR being quite popular with photo-based social media platforms/apps, and I believe, in the coming year, the use of AR technology will only be amplified. With branded content came in the method of seamlessly integrating the advertiser’s service or product into the content, ensuring higher brand-recall while making it entertaining to watch. So, AR could easily be an extension of that, wherein a viewer’s reality is augmented with a certain product or service on-screen. While digital has expanded the M&amp;amp;E sector as a whole, it has naturally transformed the advertising industry as well. AR will be yet another element that will significantly impact the way content is both delivered and consumed in the future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;There are a number of misconceptions surrounding AI. However, the M&amp;amp;E industry is successfully employing artificial intelligence to understand the needs of its consumers and ensure that they receive content in keeping with their preferences. The analysis and knowledge gathered from activities online help brands deliver better to its consumers. The knowledge saves brands from incurring significant costs, which can then be directed to bettering the consumer experience. With the technology advancing swiftly, the industry will further discover its many applications. Employing AI is certainly a win-win situation for all stakeholders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While some of the aforementioned trends have already caught-on, the others will gain momentum in the coming year and bring varied opportunities for the new-age media and traditional mediums alike. It is certainly an exciting time to be in the media and entertainment space, since the industry is widely recognized as an early adopter of any new development and technological progress. The way forward appears to be shaped by the adoption of the new, while retaining the integrity of the traditional mediums, for I believe they are here to stay.  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The author is the CEO Worldwide Media  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Disclaimer: The views expressed here are solely those of the author and do not in any way represent the views of exchange4media.com)&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>zeotap integrates with Adobe to make deterministic data accessible to advertisers </news:title>
      <news:description>Independent mobile data platform zeotap has announced that it has completed its integration with Adobe’s Audience Manager DMP (Data Management Platform) and Audience Data Marketplace. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a time when both brands and agencies alike have worked to bring their various pools of consumer data together, DMPs and Data Marketplaces are on the rise. The partnership between zeotap and Adobe is a reflection of this trend, wherein agencies and brands rely strongly on third party data to complement their own data assets and empower them across the various digital channels. Naturally, advertisers find it relatively easier to collect a set of data on their current customers, whilst being reliant on third parties to complete the picture in other areas and continuously identify promising prospects, the company said in a statement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;zeotap’s integration with Adobe is in line with an increasing need to base customer research and outreach on the same datasets and the general desire in the market to centralise intelligence. In the past, advertisers’ customer data was largely scattered across various siloes and the partnership is also another major step for zeotap on its way to make its data safely accessible within all relevant environments for its clients. The company is already directly integrated with all major DSPs (demand-side platforms), several global SSPs (supply-side platforms) and numerous major global and local publishers in the market. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As of now, zeotap’s segments can now be pushed as first party data to advertisers’ Adobe DMP seats and within the Adobe Audience Marketplace. The partnership applies to all of zeotap’s deterministic and comprehensive socio-demographic, interest and purchase intent data, which are made available in a fully privacy-compliant manner and can be leveraged across insights, modelling and activation use cases within zeotap’s core geographies, Europe, North America and India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Projjol Banerjea, Founder &amp;amp; CPO at zeotap, said, “High-quality third party data providers are scarce in today’s market, but are much needed since a first party data only approach is always limited when it comes to prospecting new customers in the short and medium term.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The integration between zeotap and Adobe closes that gap by offering accurate and verified data at scale for brands to achieve their performance objectives,” Banerjea said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;zeotap data has proven to exceed market benchmarks by up to 6 times on measured demographic On-Target Percentage (OTP) and other key performance indicators. The company has also introduced automated rigid data quality audits on top of its 3-step GDPR compliance audit across all of its data partners to crucially simplify advertisers search for good data and offer guarantees. So far, only 10% of roughly 200 potential data partners have moved through all tests successfully and were allowed to join the platform. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, with a mix of large global and local partners zeotap has by now united over 1 billion comprehensive high-quality data profiles to ensure that campaigns do not only meet or overachieve clients’ qualitative goals but also at the volumes needed to deliver large branded campaigns.</news:description>

      <news:title>Women key influencers in family’s automobile purchase: Lumiere Business Solutions</news:title>
      <news:description>Dainik Bhaskar Group conducts various campaigns and reader engagement initiatives across markets that have set benchmarks in the Indian media industry. They aim to create information pieces for advertiser, which will help attract and open minds of advertisers. To fulfill this, different information areas will be researched through multiple studies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A study conducted by Lumiere Business Solutions – a research and consulting firm, explored the role of women as a key influencer on the decision making process of the family’s purchase of an automobile, and understand media habits of consumers. These findings of the research will be used as ‘value addition’ to media partners; advertisers can use this information to influence their customers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key objectives of the research were to understand the role of women in the purchase of a four-wheeler vehicle, identify what are the internal and external deciding factors around the purchase, and also study the media consumption and habits of consumers that lead to the purchase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The research was conducted in Ahmedabad and Jaipur, through focus groups as well as interviewing couples. All respondents were taken within the age groups of 25-35 years &amp;amp; 36-45 years, comprising women with careers as well as housewives. Respondents were a mix of intenders and buyers of four-wheeler vehicle who read a newspaper at least four times a week. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Satyajit Sengupta, Chief Corporate Sales and Marketing Officer, Dainik Bhaskar Group said, “The research has revealed some important nuances of how the role of women continues to evolve as a key influencer in the decision making process of high value purchases made by a family including an automobile. Gone are the times when women would not even be considered to express their opinions in important family or domestic decisions, and rather today, they are being seen to be playing a strong supportive role in every choice being made within the family. This is a key take-away to be used in creating targeted communications for automobile and other high-value purchases which were earlier thought to be made by men. The women are the influencers who are backing final purchase decisions and hence cannot be ignored in any communication by corporates”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key findings:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The role of women has evolved over years - from earlier, not being regarded as a participant in the purchase decision for an automobile, to now becoming a key influencer in the decision making process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Overtime there has been a definite shift in the role of women from merely celebrating the purchase of a car by the family, to being an important ‘Partner’ in the decision making.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This evolving role of women, can be considered a key communications input to advertisers to design the advertising communications around purchase of an automobile by the family, keeping women at the centre of the communication.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The research reveals the different stages through which the woman of the house, guides the purchase decision: when the woman becomes the Enabler, Validator and Partner in the core decision making of the purchase of a 4-wheeler.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;While the men are the ‘financiers’ and may have more technical knowledge about automobiles, the women play an important participative role as a ‘sounding board’ across several parameters and actively leverages the internet to help in informed decision-making.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The research revealed that women keep themselves updated through internet which is the most used medium to seek information; and read various newspapers for main local news, updates about family, food and fashion; and key trends, mainly scanning through headlines due to paucity of time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women were also found to be the primary decision maker on household purchases up to Rs 5000 including children’s education, grocery and domestic expenditures. However, they are playing a ‘participative’ and ‘supportive’ role in high value purchases like consumer durables, house, jewellery and four-wheelers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Added Deepa Soman, Managing Director, Lumière Business Solutions, “An interesting observation of the research has been the changing mind set of women and their eagerness and enthusiasm in undertaking research in the form of information and deals around car purchase through the internet and other media, to support the husband’s decision towards final purchase. Women – whether housewives or professionals, are being seen to be proactively taking on more responsibility influencing the ‘right choice’ aligned to the entire family’s needs. I believe, in a way, this signifies a certain ‘soft power’ that the family may not fully acknowledge but is definitely indispensable in the ultimate car purchase decision. For advertisers, this changing role and mind set can be a mine of information to be used and explored further.”</news:description>

      <news:title>Brand Idea’s #MeriRealLife campaign urges people to use social media responsibly</news:title>
      <news:description>Addressing the growing phenomenon of the need for validation on social media, Brand Idea has launched a campaign titled #MeriRealLife, encouraging people to drop the pressure of chasing and sharing perfection on social media, and instead, share real, unfiltered stories using Idea 4G.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign went live on Tuesday with the first two TVCs breaking on the live matches of Asia Cup cricket tournament. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are over 400 million internet users in India and over 50 per cent are active social media users. Rapid proliferation of 4G has enabled better internet speeds, resulting into Indians now spending almost 28 hours a week on mobile phones. This mammoth increase in consumption of 4G data has been fuelled largely by people sharing and consuming videos and photos on social media, the company said in a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On an average, people spend anywhere between 2-4 hours/day on social media platforms. With such high engagement, social media is bound to have a huge impact on the lives of people. The new Brand Idea campaign is designed to propagate ‘responsible use of social media’ with the tagline ‘Perfect ka pressure hatao, Idea 4G ke saath apni real life dikhao’. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elaborating on the campaign thought, Sashi Shankar, Chief Marketing Officer, Vodafone Idea Limited, said, “People are constantly, looking for validation on social media for their behaviour - be it what they are eating or wearing or places they are visiting. The growing phenomenon of ‘living to share on social media’, and not the other way around, is driving people towards a dual life –a ‘social life’ and their ‘real life’.&amp;nbsp;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Through #MeriRealLife, Idea wants to power an alternate wave of thinking that encourages people to share real, unfiltered stories and drop the pressure of chasing and sharing perfection on social media. ‘MeriReallife’ is more than just a campaign; it is an idea, a contrarian way of thinking that India needs for positive social transformation”, added Shankar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Josy Paul, Chief Creative Officer &amp;amp; Chairman, BBDO India, said,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;“The Idea brand is about transformation – ‘An Idea can change your life’. In today’s world, content is nothing without context. Our idea is founded on a new-world conflict that needed urgent attention. It’s the pressure that social media and the constant need for external validation is putting on people. It’s the elephant in the room, the hidden truth. All we did was create a platform to counter this growing pressure. To create a world that’s more real. #MeriRealLife. It’s simple, empowering and transformative. It’s something that is aligned to Brand Idea’s way of looking at the world.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;br&gt;#MeriRealLife campaign is developed basis research inputs from mental health professionals from MPOWER, an organization that aims to end stigma and encourage dialogue around mental health. Insights from research by MPOWER suggest that the constant need for validation leads to a loss of self-worth, a feeling of being ‘not good enough’ resulting in anxiety and related issues, especially amongst the youth actively engaged on social media.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Staying with Brand Idea’s belief in purpose led advertising, this campaign elevates the role of Idea 4G beyond the category conversation to something that reflects its transformative role in people’s lives and society. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The high decibel campaign will lead with a series of three TVCs of 40 and 35 secs duration, capturing the concept through the lens of three people from different walks of life, sharing how their social media lives are different from their real lives.  The Idea ads show people talking about a fancy new car, the perfect look and relationship goals on their social media, while in their real lives they are questioning their own shallow behaviour. The videos end with the characters having their moment of reckoning, where they encourage the world to share their real photos and videos with #MeriRealLife. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The TVCs have been directed by Shimit Amin, the director of critically acclaimed blockbusters such as Chak De, Rocket Singh – Salesman of the year, Ab Tak Chappan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign will be promoted on TV, radio and digital through high decibel visibility across 100+ TV channels and strategic integrations in shows/programmes such as Film Companion by Anupama Chopra on digital, and popular radio shows ‘Heart to Heart with Meera’ and ‘Calling Karan’ on Ishq/Love 104.8 etc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aQbmZjiXdSI" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Joseph George of MullenLowe Lintas launches new venture- Tilt</news:title>
      <news:description>Joseph George, who quit MullenLowe Lintas as chairman, India and regional president — South and Southeast Asia, last year in July after 26 years of being in the agency, has now founded Tilt Brand Solutions. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Leadership team, Shriram Iyer (Chief Creative &amp;amp; Content Officer), Srikanth Sarathy (Chief Operating Officer), Rajiv Chatterjee (Chief Business Officer) and soon to join Kedar Teny (Chief Strategy Officer) are confident that Tilt’s “Strategy-Story-Studio” offering, driven by its twin philosophies of “Full-Brained Thinking” and “One Brand, Many Stories” could well serve as Proof Of Concept for brand owners and creative enterprises who are seeking to Influence, Engage and Entertain consumers of today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Says George, “The context in which brands operate is everything. When that changes, everything about the brand outreach needs to change. What, where and how consumers buy, and what, where and how they consume content, have all changed. These changes cannot be responded to, by shoe-horning existing models into new structures. They need to be addressed by structuring a new; not re-structuring an old. Ergo Tilt.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tilt believes that brand and communication planning today is mostly “right brained”, predicated primarily on culture, attitudes and beliefs. And while these will continue to remain critical, the plethora of actual behavioral and consumption data available today cannot be ignored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Joe adds, “We believe, that the adjacency of “Belief” insights and “Behavior” data is critical in formulating brand strategy and brand storytelling today. Inexplicably, data analytics today sits only in digital, media or analytics agencies. At Tilt though, composite teams of left and right-brained strategists evaluate brand and behavioral data in human and cultural contexts and vice versa. Specialists in brand management, consumer behavior, digital &amp;amp; media, data analytics, video analytics and communication planning work together to provide what we at Tilt call, “Full Brained Thinking.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Democratization of data and proliferation of screens of all sizes, have resulted in Indians consuming more videos than ever before; contributing so, to 70% of all IP traffic and 75% of advertising spends. Tilt believes thus, that getting right the conceptualization and production of advertising and content in the video format, has become critical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explains Joe, “Tilt’s creative philosophy of “One Brand, Many Stories” is built on the belief, that brands have, and need to tell many stories. More the stories, the more the brand begins to breathe and belong in people’s consciousness. The assumption that one video asset will work across audiences, objectives and platforms is flawed. Content creation and production needs to be tailored to each platform and experience across all forms of video-based advertising and content – from commercials to long, short and very short format video content.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our output sits in the union set of Consulting, Communication, Content and Video Production; drawing inputs however, from the intersection set of Brand building, Communication Planning, Storytelling, Analytics, Media &amp;amp; Digital strategy, Behavioral Science and Production Management. This meant that we had to look at talent with specific experience and skills; and so, our starting team couldn’t be more diverse from each other, and different from norm in terms of careers and academics - Airtel, Culture Machine, Disney, Franklin Templeton, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, IIT, Infosys, ISRO, Leo Burnett, Lintas, London School of Economics, McDonald’s, Mediacom, NID, Omnicom Media, PWC, Sony Sports, Star TV and The Viral Fever,” says Joe.</news:description>

      <news:title>Republic has been placed #7 in India’s top places to work by LinkedIn global</news:title>
      <news:description>Republic World has been placed #7 in India’s top places to work by LinkedIn global. The world’s professional network, LinkedIn, announced today the 2018 LinkedIn Top Startups List for India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The list of best start-ups offering the best opportunities and growth to start-up pros lists Republic alongside Zapr Labs and Oyo. It's a first time a media major is in the list and demonstrates the organisations commitment to the best opportunities for new age professionals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Managing Director, Editor-in-Chief and co-founder of the news channel, Arnab Goswami's Republic TV has ruled viewership ratings in the English news genre since its launch in May 2017, but bigger rival Times Now seems to be clawing its way back. Republic was successful in monetising eyeballs and went on to clock ₹155 crore in revenue for FY18. But the channel is often accused of having a pro-establishment stance and being over-dependent on Goswami. They are headquartered in Mumbai and have a global headcount of 400. Republic will set up a Hindi news channel ahead of the 2019 general elections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LinkedIn’s annual ranking is informed by the billions of actions taken by more than 50+ million professionals on the website in India, revealing the 25 most-wanted startups by professionals. It is fuelled by proprietary LinkedIn data including employment growth, engagement, job interest, and attraction of top talent combined with an editorial lens.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Topping the first edition of this list is five-year-old hospitality startup OYO (#1) followed by health and wellness startup Cure.Fit (#2), and on-demand delivery service dunzo.in (#3). From consumer tech to health tech, and logistics to hospitality, these 25 companies, through their unique offerings and bold leadership, represent the thriving startup landscape in India, the third largest startup ecosystem in the world. The debut list sees B2B companies make up 50 per cent of the list whereas 20 per cent of the companies, Nineleaps (#10), Zapr Media Labs (#17), BrowsterStack (#18), SigTuple (#20) and Exadatum (#25), are deep technology companies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Professionals turn to LinkedIn for news, views, and insights to stay informed, to hire, or to get hired. LinkedIn’s unique data helps us identify the top trends that drive India’s young economy – why these are the most preferred places to work for professionals today and how their innovative business ideas are changing the way we live. The Top Startups List, an extension of the Top Companies franchise, brings to light how these young companies are disrupting industries and attracting talent in India. The debut edition of the India list sees a diverse mix of consumer-driven businesses and B2B startups across industries such as health and wellness, hospitality, fin-tech, and e-commerce,” says Adith Charlie, India Editor, LinkedIn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are the Top 25 Startups in India, in order of ranking:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. OYO&lt;br&gt;2. Cure.Fit&lt;br&gt;3. dunzo.in&lt;br&gt;4. Rivigo&lt;br&gt;5. Digit Insurance&lt;br&gt;6. Little Black Book&lt;br&gt;7. Republic World&lt;br&gt;8. The Minimalist&lt;br&gt;9. Razorpay&lt;br&gt;10. Nineleaps&lt;br&gt;11. Innov8 Coworking&lt;br&gt;12. Schbang&lt;br&gt;13. Acko General Insurance&lt;br&gt;14. Treebo Hotels&lt;br&gt;15. InCred&lt;br&gt;16. Jumbotail&lt;br&gt;17. Zapr Media Labs&lt;br&gt;18. BrowserStack&lt;br&gt;19. Udaan.com&lt;br&gt;20. SigTuple&lt;br&gt;21. UpGrad.com&lt;br&gt;22. InterviewBit&lt;br&gt;23. Shuttl&lt;br&gt;24. Meesho&lt;br&gt;25. Exadatum Software Services&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To be eligible, companies must be independent and privately held, have 50 or more employees, be 7 years old or younger and be headquartered in the country on whose list they appear. LinkedIn excludes all staffing firms, think tanks, non-profits, accelerators and government-owned entities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LinkedIn measures startups based on four pillars: employment growth, engagement, job interest and attraction of top talent. The methodology time frame is July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Employment growth is measured as percentage headcount increase over one year, which must be a minimum of 15 per cent.&amp;nbsp;Engagement looks at non-employee views and follows of the company’s LinkedIn page as well as how many non-employees are viewing employees at that startup.&amp;nbsp;Job interest counts what rate people are viewing and applying to jobs at the company, including both paid and unpaid postings.&amp;nbsp;Attraction of top talent measures how many employees the startup has recruited away from LinkedIn Top Companies, as a percentage of the startup’s total workforce. Data is normalized across all eligible startups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LinkedIn Lists are fuelled by a combination of exclusive LinkedIn data mapping the professional landscape and an editorial lens from LinkedIn’s global editorial team.</news:description>

      <news:title>BTVI's two year success story against all odds</news:title>
      <news:description>On completing two successful years, BTVI-Business Television India, addressed the media on the overall growth, strategic developments and new digital offerings. On this occasion, Megha Tata, COO, BTVI; Siddharth Zarabi, Executive Editor, BTVI; and Anuj Katiyar, Head of Marketing - Research and Branded Content, BTVI spoke about the current dynamics in the Business News space, importance of good content, the current TG and the overall change in audience's preferences today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tata highlighted the success of the channel in the last two years where the viewership had seen a tenfold growth (from 2-4 per cent market share to 18-20 per cent market share at present). Talking about new offerings from BTVI, she elucidated on the recently launched digital assets and digital initiatives of BTVI. Reinforcing her belief, she elaborated that the channel has always believed in dedicated and in-depth research that ensures strong content. This focus on content has fuelled the growth of BTVI’s digital footprints with Twitter followers more than doubling since Jan 2017 (140,253 on 1st January 2017 to 3,43,000), she stated.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Talking about the innovations at BTVI, she highlighted the importance of building a strong digital ecosystem around the brand. To illustrate this further, she gave an example of BTVI LIVE stream being available not only on OTT platforms like Hotstar, Jio TV, YUPP TV, Tata Sky and Airtel, but also on trading apps of Kotak Securities, Axis Direct and IIFL Markets which ensures that the channel reaches directly to viewers who are consuming content similar to what BTVI is offering. BTVI has crossed 1.2 million impressions on these OTT platforms in July 2018 and the trend is upward moving. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She also mentioned about the channel ad rates, which has increased by 60 per cent, as compared to last year along with getting first time advertisers on the channel. And other established advertisers replacing other channels to include BTVI in their media plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adding to this, Zarabi spoke about the current content and how the essence of the channel has always been to educate the viewers on how to Save, Invest and Prosper. He explained about the viewership patterns, and how BTVI is at pace with the business news channels with its clear and definite content with many of the shows on the channel being genre leaders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He also spoke about how the Indian economy is transforming from being an unorganised and informal to organised and formal and that BTVI’s coverage has reflected these changes. Talking about wider audience needs – from college student studying economics to equity investor – he mentioned how BTVI has constantly innovated to adapt to the needs of its viewers over their lifecycle. Talking about BTVI’s newly launched Podcast and WhatsApp service, he elaborated on how the channel plans to engage deeply with the audiences across all platforms and at all times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the marketing front, Anuj Katiyar spoke about the channel’s credo to empower audiences to make the right financial decisions.  He elaborated on how BTVI’s continued growth amongst the English Business News genre is eating into the share of the established players in the market. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He highlighted the strategy of channel was to drive eyeballs through innovative and focussed marketing for the targeted audiences, rather than pushing out a lot of money through mindless mass media marketing. This had already shown phenomenal results in the viewership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source for all viewership related data is BARC India | Market: 6 Metros + Guj1mn+ | TG:22+MalesAB&lt;/em&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Why TV continues to be the first love of advertisers </news:title>
      <news:description>Digital has become quite the buzzword for advertisers in the last couple of years. Almost all big brands are now present on online platforms and no marketing strategy is considered complete without the inclusion of digital. In fact, according to recent KPMG report&amp;nbsp;'Media Ecosystem: The wall falls down',&amp;nbsp;digital advertising revenues registered a growth of 35 per cent in FY18 to reach Rs 11,600 crore. Television, meanwhile, had a relatively subdued year in FY18, with the overall revenue growing at a slower rate of 9.5 per cent to reach Rs 65,200 crore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While there is no doubt that digital has become a must-have for brands today and is growing fast, it is also no secret that television is still the preferred medium for advertisers. So, what is it that keeps the advertiser-television relationship going strong? Also, going ahead, will TV continue to be the first love of advertisers or will the digital push change the equation? We spoke to some experts for the answers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Sanjiv Mehta, CEO &amp;amp; MD, HUL, television is and will remain relevant in the country for many decades to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Today technology enables us to design digital communication and geo-target with personalised plans. However, some things will not change. The marketing fundamentals will remain the same. The consumer will remain at the heart of marketing. New-age content will take us to the art of new storytelling. But it would be seriously immature to write the obituary of television. Television is and will remain relevant for many decades to come in the country. But what makes people succeed in the art of being ambidextrous is balancing the online with the offline,” says Mehta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mayank Shah, Category Head, Parle Products, says that TV is the preferred medium for brands&amp;nbsp;mainly because of its sheer reach. He feels that it makes sense for brands to advertise on TV as it ensures mass targeting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There is no doubt that digital is growing and it is also an important medium. But when it comes to reach, especially for mass brands such as FMCG or daily need items, TV works better. For some time, TV will continue to have an edge over digital. Digital is the platform for brands that want to target a certain segment of audience,” he explains.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neel Kamal Sharma, COO-Buying, Madison World, says that despite losing 1 per cent share last year, television tops the advertising chart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Yes, digital advertising revenues have been growing in India and the trend will continue. However, television is still sitting on the top of the advertising revenue pie despite losing 1 per cent share last year,” he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharma adds, “Since total advertising is growing at 12 per cent and digital at 25 per cent, well-established mediums such as TV and print are likely to lose their share in the future. But the relevance of television remains. TV is the first love of FMCG players, the biggest advertising category. Also, digital-skewed categories such as smartphone, travel and even OTT platforms use TV to drive their growth.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Categories such as FMCG, telecom, BFSI, real estate and e-commerce are the main growth drivers for digital media, but some of these have a big presence in the traditional media as well. With an increase in the consumption of content such as news, entertainment and sports on digital platforms, consumers, especially the younger generation, have drifted away from traditional media and so many TV-heavy categories such as FMCG and telecom are now also using digital platforms extensively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chandramohan Mehra, Chief Marketing Officer, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, feels that the two mediums will continue to co-exist, for the next 3 to 5 years at least.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Firstly, the selection of media is the function of strategic objectives. Choice of TV or digital depends on the task at hand. Largely, for brands, an integrated approach is far more effective. TV can deliver reach while digital can deepen brand engagement. At least for the next 3 to 5 years, both the mediums will continue to co-exist despite the exponential growth rate of digital,” Mehra says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As per the KPMG report, mature TV and digital markets like the US are witnessing a shift of viewers from TV to digital-only consumption on the back of price arbitrage and strong digital infrastructure. But in India, TV offers a strong proposition in terms of price and content along with continued headroom for growth. Also, there is a lack of depth in digital infrastructure, especially fixed-line internet. As a result, digital consumption appears to be largely complementary to TV, enabling latent individual viewing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Ravish Kumar, Head– Regional TV Network, Viacom 18, TV is the single largest and cost-effective medium for reaching out to consumers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He says, “TV is measured very beautifully. Hence, you know exactly how much you are getting in terms of measurement. In that way, digital has a long way to go. In terms of content, the two are complementing each other, but digital has a lot to learn from TV and vice- versa. However, overall, TV remains the preferred medium for brands.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vidhu Sagar, National Director - PointNine Lintas at MullenLowe Lintas Group, also believes that it is always different strokes for different folks. He thinks that one general approach can’t be applied to all kind of audience. &lt;br&gt;Sagar says, “The kind of media fragmentation that is taking place today, you can’t have the same old approach of going with one broadcast medium and carrying one large creative message and letting everything else follow. In a way, such kind of an approach doesn't work anymore because things have drastically changed in the last 10 years. However, even in this changed reality, any brand that is launching cannot do without television and in many cases even print.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You can have video assets for some segments of the market on digital, but if you want to impact the overall structure and want a business of big magnitude, you will need television. If you want to add a qualitative aspect to your brand, in terms of stature, respect and credibility, you must go with the broadcast media,” he adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The KPMG report states that&amp;nbsp;digital advertisements have become mainstream in India, with digital ad spends expected to cross Rs 40,000 crore in FY 2023.1. In FY 2017, digital advertising contributed Rs 86.2 billion and is expected to grow at a rapid pace with a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30.9 per cent until 2023.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sagar mentions, “Digital has grown very rapidly, but the overall advertising budget hasn't grown in that manner for most advertisers. And so, clearly, digital is earning its revenue cutting into the share of other media. Most noticeably, it's happening at the cost of weaker media like radio, cinema, OOH and to some extent also print. Magazines are almost dead now, and also television, in some cases, may be getting impacted. But knowing that television has its own threshold cost of entry, it's not that the client will suddenly cut television and get on digital.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Indian OTT industry is currently driven by AVOD or a freemium model and SVOD is still at a nascent stage, with 2-2.4 million subscribers having directly subscribed to OTT platforms, in addition to the ones who are considered paid subscribers through telco-based access. While such telco-based subscriptions have increased in the last year, advertisement revenues have faced challenges with falling CPM rates on account of increasing ad inventory and lack of a standardised, third-party validated digital measurement tool. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Girish Menon, Partner and Head, KPMG, explains, “At the moment, CPM at digital is lower. India’s CPM is much lower than what others get on digital. That's one of the reasons why digital struggles. What you earn from digital is less than what you earn for a one-page advertising in print. Hence, that's why you need ROI and measurement to come through before the CPM starts increasing.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meanwhile, according to the KPMG report, from a relatively subdued run in FY’18, the television is expected to bounce back and continue on the growth trajectory it has been on for the last few years. The growth in TV consumption across most of the genres, coupled with traction on live and catch-up TV being viewed on digital platforms, points to the fact that television is likely to continue being the dominant mode of media consumption in India. &lt;br&gt;Television is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.6 per cent because of growing penetration, strong advertising demand on the back of domestic consumption and major events (two cricket world cups and general elections in the next five years) and support from better distribution realisations due to digitisation.</news:description>

      <news:title>Watch: Good content engages, entertains and empowers: Sunil Lulla, Balaji Telefilms</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In association with Bloomberg Quint&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, it doesn’t matter if you are a broadcaster, independent producer or multi-media brand — clear content, audience, and marketing strategies are critical for every OTT video business success. After all, they are part of every roadmap for video business growth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sunil Lulla, Group CEO, Balaji Telefilms Ltd., in conversation with exchange4media asserted, “Good content engages, entertains and empowers. If you got that right, there is no way that you will fail.” Lulla spoke about the transition of branded content, the key performance indicators for a content marketing campaign and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited excerpts: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about the transition of branded content from what it was five years ago to now?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a lot more conversation around the theme of content-marketing. Obviously, content is about creating ideas and influencing people with those ideas. There are ways to monetise it. Some people monetise it by enveloping it with advertising. We monetise it by the virtue of subscription-orientation for one of our businesses which is ALTBalaji. And obviously, there are movies that allow you to have a closer interaction, where you can put content and the idea both together. I think the notion of content-marketing is the way content reaches an&amp;nbsp;audience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, today there is a great push on digital platforms to get content to reach people and influence them through a social process versus a mass-media process. I think those are some of the changes&amp;nbsp;we’re seeing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that traditional content marketing is being left out in the digital push?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, I don’t know what traditional marketing meant. Just marketing that’s relevant, right? To me, if people were using mass-media or editorial to push content out there, it still continues. There is a lot of work to be done in that space, so I don’t think traditional is being left-out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What according to you are the key aspects of a good content marketing strategy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think getting the idea across for whom you defined it is important. Which means you need to know who is&amp;nbsp;the audience and you need to know your idea well-enough to be able to engage that audience. Good content engages, entertains and empowers. If you get that right, there is no way that you will fail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What according to you are the key performance indicators for a content marketing campaign?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;These comprise the level of engagement, maybe the level of access to that content for whom it was created and the number of people that come and sample you. Then, there is the time spent or the engagement value which is driven over there and finally what they are willing to pay for that content. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the video:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Global TV audience is growing but we can't be careless about digital: Jamie Angus, BBC&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>Early&amp;nbsp;this year, BBC appointed Jamie Angus as Director of the BBC World Service Group. As Director, Angus leads the BBC’s global news services - BBC World Service, BBC World News and BBC.com - as well as BBC Monitoring. Angus joined BBC in 1999 and completed more than 20 years with the news organisation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Angus believes that every media market is different, and so is India. “I love watching Indian news TV and all the languages, it is so vibrant and exciting,” says Angus, but he thinks that there are some gaps in the market which need&amp;nbsp;to be addressed. The media house recently launched BBC News Marathi, BBC’s first news bulletin for a mobile audience in India as part of a 24/7 video stream on the Reliance Jio TV app, titled BBC Vishwa. Angus, in conversation with exchange4media, talks about the need gaps that should be addressed in India, and BBC's growth in the market. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpts: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need gaps in the India market&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are several&amp;nbsp;things, but particularly gaps are around reporting about&amp;nbsp; women and gender issues. Also, we think there is the big skew towards male audience&amp;nbsp;in the Indian market and we want to address that. We also want to address questions around caste and other community discrimination that domestic media sometimes feels uncomfortable to address because of political pressure. Another big issue is of Pakistan, we think that BBC can report independently and robustly both from Pakistan for Indian audience&amp;nbsp;and what happens in India to the audience in Pakistan, since the BBC is trusted by both the parties to report independently. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audience shift from TV to digital&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;TV platforms are going to stay for some years to come. You need to look at how vibrant India’s news TV climate is. I think why people still want TV is because&amp;nbsp;news such as sports, live sports, drama, and national history is so compelling to consume on big TV screens. So, I think the long-term continuing success story of TV as a medium is assured and am not worried about that. Our global TV audience is growing not shrinking. So, I am confident that we have many years of life on TV services. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But like every other media organisation, we know that we can’t be careless about preparing for the digital future and particularly while catering to a very&amp;nbsp;young audience,&amp;nbsp;who&amp;nbsp;we know have never really engaged with linear TV. All they have is&amp;nbsp;digital be it&amp;nbsp;their handset, OTT or Netflix model. With that audience segment, we have big challenges to build relevance to&amp;nbsp;BBC. We don’t have an emotional connection with the new age viewers. We need to have that bond with the&amp;nbsp;younger audience&amp;nbsp;to build them into the stable audience for&amp;nbsp;the BBC in&amp;nbsp;the future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBC News Service growth in India&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think we are broadly stable. Historically we have a very large shortwave radio audience. But over time that audience starts to disappear very quickly because we don’t do shortwave anymore. The FM radio market is close to vicinity because of government regulations. So we always have to move very rapidly from the shortwave audience into TV audience. Broadly, we are holding steady growth because as quickly as we grow, the TV and digital audience is probably losing shortwave. We are holding the steady growth of 30 million mark&amp;nbsp;and that's a good place to be, but I would like us to grow more, particularly in English I think there is more headroom to grow and to reach more people on the digital platform in English. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On digital revenue&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would say digital revenue is the half of the money we make and I expect that proportion to increase. We have a robust TV distribution business which we take some revenue against to raise and distribute the news channels. So I would say the overall value of TV advertising is falling in proportion to digital advertising and that is an&amp;nbsp;industry-wide phenomenon and India is certainly in that category. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content strategy and expansion plans&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our strategy continues to reach a&amp;nbsp;larger number of audience&amp;nbsp;to grow proportionally to younger audience, women and under-served audience, and also&amp;nbsp;to reap the benefits of these four new language services, but all set to grow audience&amp;nbsp;in the English language as well. We are doing more original journalism in Indian languages and that should also be reflected in English on TV. It's an overall reach growth I would say, along with revenue and commercial share in the important markets. Also the plan is to make&amp;nbsp;shows that would connect with a&amp;nbsp;younger audience, who&amp;nbsp;don’t have the affinity with BBC.&lt;br&gt;Video:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>#HappyBdayPMModi: From humble beginnings to creating Brand NaMo </news:title>
      <news:description>From helping his father sell tea at a stall near Vadnagar railway station in Gujarat to creating brand NaMo, PM Narendra Modi’s incredible journey through his humble beginnings to the Office of Prime Minister has certainly made him the poster boy of Indian advertising. As PM Modi celebrated his 68th birthday on September 17 in Varanasi, wishes came pouring in from politicians, business leaders, sportsmen and film stars across the country. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Starting from the state of Gujarat to various other parts of the country, brand NaMo’s mystique clearly symbolises one of his famous quotes, ‘Hard work never brings fatigue, it brings satisfaction’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reminiscing his birthday celebrations, exchange4media takes you through brand Modi and his evolving online image, which has contributed successfully in narrating a story of grit, determination and strong leadership, along with setting trends across the globe.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With our Prime Minister turning 68, #HappyBdayPMModi has been one of the top trending hash tags on Twitter throughout Monday. Like every year Modi started his day by seeking blessings from his 98 year old mother, Heeraben, followed by an interaction with school students discussing the key aspects of learning in life. Later in the day, a giant 568 kg ladoo was unveiled by Union Minister Prakash Javedekar and his colleague Mukhtar A Naqvi, who also released the book ‘The Making of a Legend’ in New Delhi. Late in the afternoon, a coffee-table book titled ‘Narendra Modi: A Charismatic &amp;amp; Visionary Statesman’ was dedicated to India’s 14th PM, Modi. The 672-page book offers its readers a look into his everyday routine beginning at the crack of the dawn with his morning tea and exercise till the nightfall when he retires for the day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several public figures and brands also took to Twitter to greet Prime Minister Modi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537239708_zywoLj_Narendra_Modi_birthday_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537239708_fyoOpz_Narendra_Modi_birthday_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537239709_iO7cna_Narendra_Modi_birthday_3.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537239709_WqQIVi_Narendra_Modi_birthday_4.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537239708_25JjS5_Narendra_Modi_birthday_5.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modi’s vision - Digital India&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Modi addressing rallies one after the other, his powerful oratory skills, soon struck a chord with the masses letting his party BJP win by a whopping 282 seats out of 543 in the Lok Sabha Polls, thus crowning him as the Prime Minister of India on May 26, 2014. Since then, a new young India is seen rising with every passing day. Remember, through his speeches Modi made sure to reach out to the aspirational-middle class educated young Indians. Meanwhile, Modi’s ‘Digital India’ vision has been a frontrunner in India’s marathon towards connecting all Indians and thereby establishing a digital empowered society. Among some of his top 10 quotes trending on social media Modi once said, “E-governance is easy governance, effective governance, and also economic governance. E-governance paves the way for good governance”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consumer Insight: Schemes under Modi’s regime&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;After declaring note ban, the next big economic move made by Modi Government, certainly witnessed serpentine queue outside ATMs leading to heated debates across the globe on the after effects of demonetisation. The Modi-led-BJP Govt then termed it as a slew of measures taken to curb black money, promote digitisation and attain a less-cash economy if not a cashless one. Even if Modi’s push for a cashless economy might seem to be a distant dream now, it looks as if with the growing popularity of brand Modi there’s still hope for a cashless future going ahead under Modi’s regime. From rolling out schemes like GST,&amp;nbsp;Jan Dhan Yojana, Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code,&amp;nbsp;Modi Govt has rolled out nine key economic policies that define NaMo’s tenure so far. He is also famously known for the&amp;nbsp;campaign&amp;nbsp;Swachh Bharat Abhiyan&amp;nbsp;that aims to clean up the streets, roads and infrastructure of India's cities, smaller towns, and rural areas. He also made&amp;nbsp;linking Aadhaar card mandatory to get benefits of all government services.&amp;nbsp;For good or bad, these policies each delineate the direction of Modi Govt’s economic thinking, thereby stating how brand Modi rules despite the cracks.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand Modi love&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year around December, Twitter was also abuzz with prominent CEOs showering praises on Modi’s reformist government, as India jumped 30 places into the list, breaking into the top 100 of World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business ranking. With ‘Make in India’ another signature initiative of his, Modi vowed to turn India into a rising ‘New India’ offering great potential for global investors. Not only this, he was also featured among the 10 most powerful people in the world as per U.S magazine Forbes’ 2018 list. He was also featured on the cover of the world’s most prestigious TIME magazine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fashion Icon&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also famously known as the ‘King of Governance, Prime Minister Modi has not taken a single leave till date. Along with re-defining India’s future, Modi has made sure that he scores a 100/100 on the fashion score board as well. From bandh-gala suits, Nehru jackets, traditional turbans, pashmina shawl to his signature half-sleeves kurta and churidars, Modi continues to inspire many by his impeccable fashion sense. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From practising Yoga and making it a global phenomenon to being the first Indian PM to click selfies, brand NaMo continues to break barriers and set trends.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand NaMo’S positioning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brand NaMo has efficiently focused on a single minded proposition clearly positioning itself as a synonym for ‘Development’. With this as his vision for Brand India, shouldn’t the saffron party be confident of a bigger win in the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha polls?</news:description>

      <news:title>Apollo Tyres and Mindshare collaborate to unleash 'The Beast'</news:title>
      <news:description>Apollo Tyres in collaboration with Mindshare, has launched an integrated 360-degree campaign for its two-wheeler radial tyres, Apollo Alpha. The ‘Beast’ is set to unleash itself through the digital platform YouTube and Facebook, following which the commercial will take over the other mediums such as, television, radio, print and OOH. Through this power-packed campaign, Apollo Tyres is set to create a distinct spot for itself. The campaign is especially focused to garner the attention of biking enthusiasts who are constantly on the move for their love of roads. It seeks to earn better brand visibility and immediate reach among the young, enthusiastic and adventurous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conceptualised by J Walter Thompson, produced by Small Fry Productions, and with Mindshare as the media agency, the riveting TVC for Apollo Alpha seeks to add more ‘thrill to the beast (bike)’, which is the key message for the company’s two-wheeler radial tyres. The campaign aims at establishing Apollo Tyres as a high-technology brand, which has introduced India’s first steel-belted radial tyres for the high-performance motorcycles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There were two key aspects to address in media, while at the core is the high energy, risk taking millennial who is also conscious of safety, the additional task is to extend the halo of the Apollo Alpha brand on to the two wheeler tyres portfolio. We take a holistic view of media with the principle that all journeys begin and end in media – ‘Connected Journeys’. Time, location and (media) destination are the 3 dimensions of audience behaviour that have informed our choices in media – From genres, time bands and programming on TV to audience segments, time band, context and location on digital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharing her thoughts on the campaign, Ruchi Mathur, Senior Vice President, Client Leadership, Mindshare North &amp;amp; East said “Our task was to bring alive the connected journeys for this campaign by leveraging our proprietary tools, platforms and partnerships, like [m]insights and the Adaptive Marketing Framework. We needed both scale and agility to address our discerning cohort of bike riders. You will see an interesting swing in this campaign - from leveraging high interest properties like MotoGP on digital, to creating thrill and adventure through Movie Festivals, to building reach through presence during Asia Cup 2018 reality shows like Bigg Boss.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the campaign launch, Satish Sharma, President, Asia Pacific, Middle East &amp;amp; Africa (APMEA), Apollo Tyres Ltd, said “This campaign on our two-wheeler radials is targeted towards those biking enthusiasts who like to ride carefree in their high-performance bikes, and would enjoy the cutting edge technology of Apollo Alpha. Our brief to the agency was to convey Apollo as a high technology brand, which has category leading products in its portfolio”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apollo Alpha: 'zero degree' steel belt Motorcycle Radial has been designed and developed in-house at Apollo Tyres’ Global R&amp;amp;D Centre, Asia in Chennai, with the primary focus on grip and safety, with optimised tread mileage. It has been designed with high silica reinforced compound for best grip during cornering and other forms of maneuverings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>The Hindu Theatre Fest celebrates its 14th edition with house full shows</news:title>
      <news:description>A myriad of emotions, moments of deafening silence, voices that resonate, words that pierce right through the heart, laughter that can almost knock one off the seat or the cliff-hanger effect and productions that linger; making one come back again the next year. All this and more is what The Hindu Theatre Fest has to offer. The 14th edition had the curtains brought down with a standing ovation in the last week of August, contributing to a season of eclectic mix from gangster comedies and psychological thrillers to mythic battles. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537189932_tj0vIj_A-still-from-%27%27Detective-9-2-11%27%27.jpg" style="width:443px;height:285px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A still from 'Detective'&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;A three day gala of nine plays in Hindi and English were lined up in the cities of Chennai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad registering a house full at every show. Each play being unique in its genre, made way to the infinite possibilities of enjoying theatre at its best! As always, 2018 saw a star-studded direction and cast, from Naseeruddin Shah’s direction of an all-female cast for “Aurat! Aurat! Aurat!”, Mahesh Dattani directing Manjari Fadnis in “Double Deal Reloaded”, director and actor of “Barff” Saurabh Shukla alongside Sadiya Siddiqui and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537189796_HHYGtD_Winner-of-The-Hindu-Playwright-Award---Annie-Zaidi.jpg" style="width:443px;height:455px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hindu Playwright Award winner&amp;nbsp;Annie Zaidi for “Untitled 1”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;At The Hindu Theatre Fest, it was also time to recognise best original, unpublished and unperformed play scripts in English. The Hindu Playwright Award, instituted in 2008, carries a cash prize of Rs 2 lakh and is open to writers above the age of 18 who are Indian citizens or have been residents of India for the last five years. This year the winner of The Hindu Playwright Award was Annie Zaidi for “Untitled 1”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537189931_VhAnTm_A-still-from-%27%27Bali%27%27.jpg" style="width:443px;height:348px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;A still from 'Bali'&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Hindu Theatre Fest has nearly 10,000 people attending each year with multiple brand associations.

This project is supported by all the employees of the Joyalukkas Group, as well as a large number of well wishers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Chairman of the Joyalukkas Group, Joy Alukkas, as well as the Director of the Joyalukkas Foundation, Jolly Joy have stated that the Joyalukkas Foundation will see that houses costing six lakhs each will be constructed. “Our dream is to construct houses which will bring joy to the hearts of those who own them,” they said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537187792_VuysPq_JOYSIR.jpg" style="width:300px;height:299px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mr. Joy Alukkas, Chairman of Joyalukkas Group&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each house will have a total area of 600 sq.ft. with two bedrooms, a living cum dining room, kitchen and sit out, and will have a concrete roof. Chairman of Joyalukas Group, Joy Alukkas also said that in the worst affected areas, houses will be built in tune with the environment only after proper consultation with expert architects and according to the plans submitted by them. The purpose of this mega project by the Joyalukkas Group is to support the Government of Kerala’s initiative in rebuilding Kerala, thus helping the people to live through the destruction caused by the flood. He also said that the project had been submitted to the Chief Minister and would be carried out with the help of the self governing bodies in each place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those who have lost their homes in the floods and landslides may submit their applications in person at the sales outlet of the Joyalukkas Group nearest to them. These applications will be carefully reviewed by a committee constituted by the Joyalukkas Foundation and in consultation with the local self governing bodies. A list of deserving candidates would be drawn up and construction will start as soon as all governmental formalities are met. It is hoped that the houses will be quickly completed and handed over to their owners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Joyalukkas Foundation continues to give compassionate leadership in several social and humanitarian ventures. The Joyalukkas Foundation continues to render humanitarian services through activities such as, voluntary blood donation, protection of the environment, health care and many others.</news:description>

      <news:title>Flipkart rumoured to be in talks for stake in Hotstar  </news:title>
      <news:description>Walmart Inc’s Flipkart is speculated to be in talks to buy a stake in Hotstar, Star India’s OTT service, according to media reports. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the deal works out, Flipkart will become the latest entrant in India’s over-the-top space which is buzzing with players such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video India, among others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, according to reports, the talks have not reached an advanced stage yet and there are chances of it not materialising as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There have been reports that in the past six months, the e-commerce giant has held talks with several other streaming services but nothing&amp;nbsp;materialised.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;exchange4media called Hotstar for a confirmation, but is&amp;nbsp;yet to&amp;nbsp;get a response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Earlier in July, the two companies had joined hands to launch an ad platform called Shopper Audience Network which allows brands to connect with customers through personalised TrueIntent video ads on Hotstar. The platform, developed by Flipkart, uses deterministic audience-based insights to help brands connect with users by leveraging the e-commerce website's understanding of users’ purchase journey and the massive scale of TrueIntent video ads. It will help serve personalised advertising to over 150 million users across hundreds of categories.</news:description>

      <news:title>Heidi CGI series comes to Sun Network's Chutti TV</news:title>
      <news:description>Studio 100 Media moves to further strengthen the presence of its animated shows in Asia by signing a deal with Sun Network that picked up the CGI animated series 'Heidi'. The series was successfully launched on the Tamil block on Sun TV’s pay TV kid’s channel Chutti TV, following a month of heavy promotion for the show. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chutti TV had also broadcast the classic 2D animated TV series of “Heidi” which was produced in the 1970s, celebrating worldwide success. The famous character was created in 1880 by Johanna Spyri who released two books about the events in the life of a young girl in her grandfather’s care in the Swiss Alps. There are several film and television productions of the original story, including the 1970 Japanese anime series, distributed by Studio 100 Media, and the CGI remake which was produced by Studio 100 Animation and for which 26 new adventures for season 2 are currently in production.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1537181429_i177lr_HEIDI_CGI_KeyVisual_Press-Image01.jpg" style="width:300px;height:425px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In February 2017, the Studio 100 Group acquired the majority interest in m4e AG. Cooperating closely on projects - from the first idea to a kid’s smile in one of the theme parks - the companies will use their synergies in both national and international activities. Under the roof of Studio 100, one of the largest European companies for children’s and family entertainment is now formed.</news:description>

      <news:title>Asian Paints’s new campaign #PeopleAddColour has been conceptualised by Ogilvy</news:title>
      <news:description>Asian Paints’ new corporate TVC, #PeopleAddColour, has been created on the belief that people add colour to our homes and create unforgettable memories. Building on the brand’s existing corporate positioning ‘Har Ghar Kuch Kehta Hai’, the new TVC signifies how people and the joy of redecorating one’s home can create colourful moments and memories to be cherished for years to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conceptualised by Ogilvy India, the main film in which an elderly couple, who are empty nesters, recreate a sense of home with strangers. It opens to an intriguing scenario of a lady who sees her husband re-doing their son’s room with the help of painters. On questioning her husband about why the room is being re-decorated, he mentions that just as their son has been welcomed into the home of another family abroad, there will other kids living away from their families whom they could provide a home to as a paying guest. Recognising the importance of how people can add colour to one’s life, the mother favourably agrees. The film proceeds to a montage of different youngsters who have had a warm and memorable experience with the couple.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The film concludes with a wall adorned with photographs and colourful memories with their paying guests in the couple’s home, beautifully capturing the brand message, ‘Ghar sajta hai uski chahal pahal se.’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This thought is taken further with a set of 20 sec films, print, outdoor, retail promotion, radio spots, digital engagement and on-ground activation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the new corporate ad, Amit Syngle, COO, Asian Paints Limited said, “With the new corporate TVC #PeopleAddColour, our core objective is to recapture the essence of how people who live under the same roof bring colour to each other’s lives while highlighting the emotional equity a home holds. Building on our positioning and expression of ‘Har Ghar Kuch Kehta Hai’, we aim to resonate with our consumers by instilling empathy and meaning into decor.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sukesh Nayak, Chief Creative Officer, Ogilvy Mumbai said, “People make homes beautiful. #PeopleAddColour celebrates this thought and encourages people to make their homes happier. The launch film for this campaign is a beautiful story of an empty nester couple. A story that will probably resonate with lots of people across India. When their son leaves to study abroad, the couple decides to redecorate their son’s room and open it for other children. Filling their life with joy. Making their home happier again.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tsr__4-YTYs" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;                                                                                 &lt;br&gt;CREDITS&lt;br&gt;Client: Asian Paints&lt;br&gt;Agency: Ogilvy Mumbai&lt;br&gt;Ogilvy Creative: Sukesh Nayak, Kunal Sawant, Vivek Verma, Prasad Kulkarni, Akshay Gawde, Mithun Rajam, Shrinjayi Sengupta&lt;br&gt;Ogilvy Planning: Prem Narayan, Vipasha Bhuptani, Nadia Miranda&lt;br&gt;Ogilvy Account Management: VR Rajesh, Manish Tilwani, Pradeep Rao, Amrita Basu, Ritu Pandya&lt;br&gt;Production House: Corcoise Films&lt;br&gt;Director: Prasoon Pandey  &lt;br&gt;Producer: Cyrus Pagdiwala</news:description>

      <news:title>fbb partners with Mouni Roy to unveil World’s First Glam Tram </news:title>
      <news:description>Trams are one of the oldest modes of transportation available in the country, and Kolkata was the first city in Asia where the first electric tram ran. However, with newer and more convenient modes of transport coming in, the rich heritage of trams was nearly forgotten. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This Pujo, fbb - one of India’s largest fashion retail brands, decided to revamp the tram, deck it up and make it more fashionable than it could ever be to ensure more people would make use of it. With the objective of launching fbb’s Pujo collection, Digital Media Agency Social Kinnect coined the term Glam Tram and thus began the saga of the World’s First Glam Tram that would go through the city like a mobile store.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To add to this grandeur, fbb partnered with Mouni Roy who unveiled the collection by being the first one to get on the tram. She launched this special range in the tram amidst a large audience awaiting the tram’s arrival at Nonapukur Tram Depot at Mallick Bazaar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Collaborating with influencers from around the country and celebrities from Kolkata, the event was a grand success. People can experience the splendid fashion on wheels by hopping on World’s First Glam Tram that’ll run through Kolkata for the span of a month or beyond and shop the Pujo collection before it’s too late! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Google Maps promotes their 2-wheeler mode in a campaign by Lowe Lintas</news:title>
      <news:description>Lowe Lintas Delhi has conceived a campaign for Google Maps, promoting their 2-wheeler mode in the Indian market. &lt;br&gt;India is the largest market for two-wheelers globally and two-wheelers represent 70 per cent of all registered motor vehicles in India, the company said in a statement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The two-wheeler mode was launched on Google Maps in Dec 2017 to address the needs of this large segment. Given the high relevance of two-wheeler mode to the Indian market, the campaign aims to increase awareness and usage of two-wheeler mode. The campaign thought is based on something that is behavioral and deeply engrained in our habits.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credits:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Creative: Janmenjoy Mohanty, Kanishka Vashishth, Nikhil Kumar, Vedansh Kumar, Megha Joshi&lt;br&gt;Account Management: Nikhil Mahajan, Dallbir Singh, Naman Pal, Ambika Roy&lt;br&gt;Account Planning: Anurag Prasad, Punit Singh&lt;br&gt;Director: Amit Sharma, (Chrome Pictures)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ql60fKxiOVw" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff buys Time Magazine for $190 million</news:title>
      <news:description>Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne Benioff are buying Time Magazine for $190 million from Meredith Corp. The Wall Street Journal first reported the sale, which is expected to close in the next 30 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The development was announced to Time staffers by its editor in chief Edward Felsenthal, who told employees on Sunday night that “Benioffs will hold Time as a family investment.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"It will have no connection to Salesforce, the software company Marc founded in 1999," Felsenthal said in media reports. "While they will not be operators of the business, we are extremely fortunate to have Marc and Lynne's guidance and mentorship as we set out to build a new company."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is not the first time that a tech CEO is buying a prestigious print publication. Jeff Bezos had purchased The Washington Post for $250 million nearly five years ago. The Post purchase was separate from Bezos's role as CEO as Amazon. Now, Benioff is promising a similar arrangement with Time.&lt;br&gt;Benioff said in an email to CNN, "Lynne and I will take on no operational responsibility for Time, and look only to be the stewards of this historic and iconic brand."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meredith bought Time magazine and the rest of Time Inc. last November. The company promptly said it would sell some titles that were not a great fit with its existing titles, including Time. Meredith confirmed the sale plans back in March. It had hoped to strike a deal within a couple of months, but the process took much longer than expected, say reports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meredith is also working on selling three other former Time Inc. titles: Fortune, Money, and Sports Illustrated. A Meredith spokeswoman said in media reports that deals for the other three titles are expected to be announced in the "near future."</news:description>

      <news:title>Uber rebrand: Will clean logo usher in good times for the brand?</news:title>
      <news:description>In a bid to spruce up its public image, ride-hailing app Uber has recently undergone yet another rebranding exercise. This includes a new logo sans the all-caps look. The new logo is a simple ‘Uber’, written in a custom-designed typeface.&lt;br&gt;The clean design will appear everywhere that the Uber icon currently appears including its Twitter account, website and mobile app.&lt;br&gt;The redesign process took nine months to conclude and was aided by brand consultancy Wolff Olins together with type foundry MCKL, say reports.&lt;br&gt;To create further harmony between its divisions,  Uber will also rebadge its Uber Eats division with the same lower-case look in the Uber Move font. &lt;br&gt;Interestingly, Uber’s last rebrand was just over two years ago, in February 2016.&lt;br&gt;In a statement, an Uber spokesperson told Mashable: “We’re excited to unveil a new, simplified logo for the Uber app that brings back the U, is easily recognisable, and is scalable across the 660 plus cities we serve.”&lt;br&gt;Rebranding is not just the one thing Uber is looking at in an attempt to undergo a brand clean-up. Earlier this year, Uber appointed Ruby Zefo as its first chief privacy officer following accusations of hiding a data breach that affected almost 57 million users. Uber’s chief legal officer Tony West had reportedly then told employees in an email that Zefo would fill "a critical global role responsible for the development and implementation of privacy standards, procedures, and processes" in every market Uber operates.</news:description>

      <news:title>With Janhvi Kapoor, will tap into mainstream media: Falguni Nayar, Nykaa</news:title>
      <news:description>Mumbai-based e-commerce portal Nykaa has become synonymous to online beauty shopping. Growing at 25 per cent month-on-month, it is the fastest growing colour cosmetics brand in India's $6.5 billion cosmetics.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is reported to close the year ending March 2018 with Rs 570 crore, up from Rs 214 crore in the year-ago period according to media reports. Now it's on its way to go public in two years. According to media reports the company looks to double its revenue to around Rs 11 billion by 2018-19 end as it is bringing in new brands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now with roping in actress Janhvi Kapoor as its brand ambassador (both for its private label and e-commerce) it's looking to be aggressive in its positioning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before Kapoor it worked with social media influencers and make up bloggers on digital for its social media campaigns. Falguni Nayar, Founder, Nykaa, shared that they will tap mainstream media, “In the past we have been fully digital. But now we will be go non-digital at theatres, TV and print.” The actress will play an active role in the brand's social media campaigns. A TVC is also in the plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Customer pull and engagement has been the key to Nykaa's success which in the past saw a lot of content on its social media pages. The brand plans to build on that. Nayar pointed out, “We should not push the customer to check out fast. We should educate them on new ingredients and brands and facilitate learning through experiential marketing. We have taken that approach. So the customer spends 7-8 minutes on our website, goes through multiple visits before they buy, which doesn't bother us. We think of it is as a path to their journey, not a constraint.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the marketing budget Nayar shared, “Like any consumer brand a certain percentage of the turnover will go into marketing (tends to be double digit). We will play around with the mix depending on the phase which we are and objective.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nayar further shared growth plans on e-commerce side, “We are planning to grow at a similar pace 100 per cent year-on-year. We will continue to bring a lot of international brands into India, huge range of imported brands from Korea and the US. We are expanding men-centric site called Nykaa Man. We also introduced fashion site called Fashion Design Studio. We are growing our private label brands. We are expanding into bath and body range.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reena Chhabra, CEO, FSN Brands Marketing, pointed out that with the company growing 25 per cent month-on-month it's already ahead of the industry. She credited it to e-commerce, retail expansion and branding. She said, “Right now we are ramping up our distribution channel. We have gone into beauty counters including modern trade and lifestyle.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After tasting success online the e-commerce major took the offline strategy and in two years it has opened 22 stores across country reportedly in two formats Nykaa Luxe and Nykaa On Trend. The offline route contributes to 10 per cent of its revenue but it also brings in engagement. Nayar is looking at 45 stores by end of March 2019. “It's already underway as the locations are selected and construction is going on. We will have big footprint for physical retail as we are aiming for 100 stores in next few years,” Nayar explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In luxury category it recently opened its flagship Nykaa Luxe store in Delhi offering luxe brands across makeup, skincare, fragrances, such as Estée Lauder, Bobbi Brown, Clinique, Christian Dior, Givenchy and Kama Ayurveda among others. The e-commerce first introduced luxury beauty products to online Indian consumer in 2016 from brands like Bobbi Brown and Estee Lauder. In a short span of time it expanded its portfolio to 50 brands. Now this segment reportedly accounts for over 15 per cent of the total sales.</news:description>

Some of the brands she has shaped in the past include Ford, Citibank, Swatch, MontBlanc, Volkswagen, PETRONAS, Heineken, Amstel, Kingfisher Ultra, and Ultra Max. &lt;br&gt;In an interaction with exchange4media, she&amp;nbsp;spoke about her new role at FCB Ulka, factors that shaped her career and&amp;nbsp;her vision for the agency.&amp;nbsp;Excerpts:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations on the new role, tell us about your vision for FCB Ulka as the new Head of Office for Bengaluru?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a fabulous set up, one&amp;nbsp;where my seniors were particular of whom to bring on&amp;nbsp;board and I hope I can live up to that. We have a fine crop of clients who are brilliant human beings and thinkers. They are in the game for the&amp;nbsp;long run. I am very blessed because I have been given great people to work with; they are young, dynamic, self-driven, energetic and more&amp;nbsp;importantly good human beings.  There is a new vibrancy&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;FCB and my mandate here is to&amp;nbsp;help bring the new and emerging narrative&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;Bengaluru. &lt;br&gt;It is said that advertisement is a young man’s game, I say it’s not true, a young man can create things based only on the clarity that&amp;nbsp;seniors bring to the table. Clarity only comes with experience, high intelligence, ability to dissect and differentiate&amp;nbsp;issues and challenges at hand.&amp;nbsp;Importantly,&amp;nbsp;FCB is apolitical, your work is your calling card. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another key focus is to bring the robust DNA of FCB India to Bengaluru. I will also be looking to bring that to the clients here. Digital&amp;nbsp;integration is something I am concentrating on. Our idea is to build a&amp;nbsp;digital ecosystem for clients in Bengaluru and we are not talking just about digital media buying or programmatic. We are talking about clients who understand&amp;nbsp;digital as a medium&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;recognise that&amp;nbsp;audience on the digital medium need&amp;nbsp;to be&amp;nbsp;spoken to and engaged with in a particular way.&amp;nbsp;There are pure-play digital agencies, there are agencies that have digital as a division within them and then there is&amp;nbsp;FCB, which has an integrated team for digital. Everything is done together seamlessly, so, for the client it is one budget, one point of contact and one metric of effectiveness. These are things that FCB has already armed me with and&amp;nbsp;as a result, we grow the office, grow the client base, and&amp;nbsp;become a larger agency in&amp;nbsp;Bengaluru&amp;nbsp;so that we can command a better foot print in the city.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From a physics graduate to a brand communications specialist, tell us about this transition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I grew up in&amp;nbsp;Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu,&amp;nbsp; it is a small town with very little distraction. I recall my childhood when I would fight with&amp;nbsp;my&amp;nbsp;father for&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;magazines like India Today so that I could look at ads.  &lt;br&gt;You had&amp;nbsp;limited career options in those days.&amp;nbsp;Engineering&amp;nbsp;shapes your environment better&amp;nbsp;with construction,&amp;nbsp;medicine is supposed to heal you, but here was an industry with&amp;nbsp; a&amp;nbsp;bunch of people shaping minds, giving dreams a tangible look and feel. Growing up in a place like Tuticorin, my world view&amp;nbsp;came from newspapers&amp;nbsp;and books. Then TV came along, and&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;explosion of&amp;nbsp;cable revolution happened.&amp;nbsp;Advertising seniors&amp;nbsp;were telling me a lot&amp;nbsp;more richer things.&amp;nbsp;That captured my imagination and I knew that I had my calling in advertising and brand building. I owe everything to my father, not only did he give&amp;nbsp;me&amp;nbsp;the joy of learning,&amp;nbsp;but he made me a student for life.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Even today while I hire people, my key look out&amp;nbsp;is where they are&amp;nbsp;from and how much drive they have, it&amp;nbsp;doesn’t matter how much of the world they&amp;nbsp;know.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have played a major role in shaping brands like Citi Bank, Swatch, Ford, Volkswagen, Heineken, etc. Out of all this, which has been the most challenging one?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In every step of one’s&amp;nbsp;career , challenges are different. Taking an example of&amp;nbsp;my stint with Ford. I did something called Project Dragon Fly, which is a global website platform for Ford Global, which was rolling out in various regions. I was at&amp;nbsp;the Indian hub for rolling out that website, so the learning of that was enormous. I also did an All India Roadshow with Ford during its centennial celebrations, which was an actual on ground learning.&amp;nbsp;It was an augmented learning for me, so in that part of my career that was great. Likewise, I have&amp;nbsp;had different level of experiences and challenges at different organisations where I have worked. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to you, where does FCB’s creative strength lie?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;FCB Ulka is full of great people who are great observers of people, fabulously tuned&amp;nbsp;to client business needs. It is a magical combination. They are very careful of who they are hiring, so they hire people who have the same business&amp;nbsp;acumen. If you are in FCB, it is akin to&amp;nbsp;going to one of the Ivy League Universities, you have to earn your seat at the table. &lt;br&gt;Also, humility in a client is very rare and it is very valuable. If you have a client who is humble you can work magic together. A lot of times we forget that we are people first and only after that do&amp;nbsp;titles follow.&amp;nbsp;FCB picks its client roster well.  &lt;br&gt;The quality of content&amp;nbsp;for the clients, quality of internal conversations, the meritocracy that comes with doing things, that’s the culture here. If you have to strip it down, the strength of FCB Ulka is its people, they are razor sharp-people who are great human beings.&amp;nbsp;Importantly, the FCB credo is “Never finished”, How wonderful is that!&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Budgets are on a decline, how are you striking a balance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The country has undergone&amp;nbsp;a huge transition, from having one TV Channel only thirty years ago to&amp;nbsp;the explosion of&amp;nbsp;cable channels in India.&amp;nbsp;Not only do&amp;nbsp;you have Television, there is a huge layer of consumption that is happening in Digital too. With the medium growing the way it is, not only&amp;nbsp;does&amp;nbsp;your appetite as a client grow&amp;nbsp;but also&amp;nbsp;that of a multitude&amp;nbsp;of people and you have competition that has&amp;nbsp;come up. The way you could show margins in the past years, you can’t show it today. If you had a great quarter, you can’t guarantee that your next quarter is going to be fabulous too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;It is a difficult game when you are a client. I can put this way, we all run families, inflation is real. Base line has gone up, just because of that you don’t stop buying provisions, but it&amp;nbsp;can make your budgets stretch, which is exactly happening in the&amp;nbsp;board room.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;An important question to ask here is, if something is essential to my life, will I slim down that particular essential? It depends upon how much value an agency is able to bring to their clients and how much value clients see in that agency. &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leading advertisers are taking digital media buying in-house. What are your thoughts on this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, let me try to answer this with&amp;nbsp;an example. Assume that,&amp;nbsp;you are a country built&amp;nbsp;with a lot of defence mechanisms into your nation’s defence plans, let’s say your army is very good. You are under threat from a neighbouring country whose navy is very strong. So that particular country is attacking you from naval points. You can look at that and say I am going to build my navy now or you can say I have a naval ally and I am going to give them the charge of my naval base. The point I am making is that this is the market today.&amp;nbsp;   In the past people have taken their advertising&amp;nbsp;in-house, now they are building digital agencies in-house. Is it right or is it wrong?&amp;nbsp;I think it is myopic.  Digital ecosystem&amp;nbsp;is building as we go along. It is a community of&amp;nbsp;people who are hard-pivoting into future where the consumers are&amp;nbsp;going to go.&amp;nbsp;Now it is very dangerous to isolate yourself from the building process, a&amp;nbsp;tertiary party like&amp;nbsp;an&amp;nbsp;agency is an ally.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We may be able to foresee trends that you may&amp;nbsp;miss. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your creative strategy and focus areas for FCB Ulka going forward? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clients&amp;nbsp;are under enormous business pressure and it has passed on into the agency relationships.&amp;nbsp;Hence, brands have&amp;nbsp;stopped giving people something to enjoy. We have become very emotional as a country; every advertisement has&amp;nbsp;become a&amp;nbsp;tear-jerker. We are just&amp;nbsp;preaching&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;the country, so&amp;nbsp;we need to bring the&amp;nbsp;lightness back because if someone is giving their time to you, you need to give them something that is fun, leaves them smiling&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;also&amp;nbsp;conveys&amp;nbsp;a message that connects with their heart.&amp;nbsp;This puts your brand at the front and centre without being obnoxious. So, my agenda at FCB&amp;nbsp;Ulka&amp;nbsp;is to do that for all my clients.&amp;nbsp;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the legacy you want to leave behind&amp;nbsp;as a woman leader?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have met too many women who are men in skirts. I want women to be women and I want them to bring their unique ability as a fairer gender. Women inherently are more compassionate, nurturing, collaborative, and we are more protective, which is why they say&amp;nbsp;they need 30% representative of women in the&amp;nbsp;board room. &lt;br&gt;My legacy as a woman leader will be to make the&amp;nbsp;work place a fun, collaborative, razor sharp, dynamic place, which will be able to attract the best talent and the best crop of clients.</news:description>

      <news:title>We now want to be a global foods company: Varun Berry, MD, Britannia</news:title>
      <news:description>Britannia recently announced a&amp;nbsp;massive rebranding exercise to celebrate its 100th anniversary. This rebranding exercise is also a manifestation of Britannia’s new strategy to consolidate its presence&amp;nbsp;pan India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In an exclusive interview, Varun Berry, Managing Director, Britannia Industries, spoke about brand reinvention and how Britannia is aiming for a bigger market share. Edited Excerpts: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about the massive rebranding exercise, which you have undertaken recently, what was the thought behind it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was not a small exercise. We researched this for almost a year and when we went to the consumers, what came out was like a fulcrum. We have excitement on the&amp;nbsp;one side and goodness on the other and we were perfectly balanced. All other food brands in India would tilt to&amp;nbsp;one side versus the other. So what was required was modernisation. With that insight in mind, we started to evaluate things and we also did an alienation test with current consumers and it came out that they liked it (the idea of rebranding). Most of the current consumers also thought that this was a more modern logo, so that&amp;nbsp;gave us the confidence that this is the right way forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The longevity of brand Britannia is a case study in itself. How would you define the factors that have made it such a robust brand?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a humble start, what we have been able to do is fairly rare, if you think about it.  We have made sure that we keep the structure tight and that we don’t build structures which are not required. We are a fairly large organisation at&amp;nbsp;Rs 10,000 crore, but it seems like a small family.  It does not look like&amp;nbsp;we are working in a large company that has&amp;nbsp;spread-out operations and is&amp;nbsp;hierarchical.  These are the things that we have been able to create and I feel proud of it.&lt;br&gt;What we have also done is to focus on one part of the business and build that into a very large business.  Biscuits are a large part of our business and in fact,&amp;nbsp;five years back there were some other businesses we had gotten into, which we shut since we thought there is so much to do in the core business (alone).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your vision to create an end-to-end macro snacking company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The macro snacks category is huge. In India there is a lot of snacking that happens through the day, and there has been replacement of street food to a large extent with&amp;nbsp;packaged food&amp;nbsp;because hygiene has become an important factor.&lt;br&gt;Our job is to create an end-to-end macro snacking company and bring in products which are exciting, tasty and certainly more hygienic. So that really is what we are going to do. But it is not that we are going to take up a gun and start shooting in every direction. So every category will have to be assessed, we have done a lot of work.  We are taking stock of the situation&amp;nbsp;category by category, assessing whether we have a right to&amp;nbsp;succeed&amp;nbsp;in that that category, and if we do, we look at the kind of products we can do.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;strong&gt;What would you call your three biggest learnings at Britannia?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learnings are every&amp;nbsp;day but the biggest ‘aha’ for me is the tremendous talent that Britannia has been able to build. My learning is that collaborative working at the top and building a very deep base of talent through the organisation is very critical. Second learning is that your base has to be very solid. If you try to do too many things at the same time your base will be a little wobbly and you could get into trouble. That is what we did when we walked away from a lot of other stuff we were doing and first&amp;nbsp;built&amp;nbsp;a very solid base and then moved on to other categories. Third is the distribution network. When I was a management trainee in Brooke Bond,  I was doing a salesman stint in Jalandhar and what struck me was the kind of distribution Britannia had and I used to ask people who is the Britannia distributor because it was all pervasive even&amp;nbsp;while Brooke Bond was a very strong company.&lt;br&gt;Over a period of time something happened to the distribution set up, which I obviously missed because I was working with different companies. But clearly something happened; I think we became a little transactional in our approach. As far as distribution is concerned, it is about the hard yards of getting the product in,&amp;nbsp;otherwise even a strong brand like Britannia can lose it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your strategy for the international markets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are going to be a total foods company and we want to be a global foods company. We have got to assess where it&amp;nbsp;is our right to succeed and move into those markets. So getting into the right market and&amp;nbsp;setting up manufacturing units in markets where we have a right to succeed are our top priorities. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You do&amp;nbsp;have pockets of dominance&amp;nbsp;but&amp;nbsp;how are you looking at a strong pan India strategy now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;This company has been very cost conscious. We operate with the mindset of saving every penny. The kind of work we do, we save around Rs 200-250 crore every year.&lt;br&gt;Tamil Nadu is our strongest market. If you start looking at the country in concentric circles, what you see is that the strongest part is Tamil Nadu. As you start moving away from Tamil Nadu, you start to see a weakening of share. Towards the east it is a little stronger, towards the west it’s okay, and as you start to move towards north, it starts to fade. It is easy to say that in Gujarat we want to go from 10 per cent to 30 per cent, but it doesn’t happen. For that you have to do some short term measures, you have to do discounts, you have to do unsustainable advertising and in doing that,&amp;nbsp;the cost structure goes for a toss.&lt;br&gt; We used to have four or five states with a&amp;nbsp;single digit&amp;nbsp;share and now there is no state where we are in single digits.&amp;nbsp;In all the Hindi speaking states, the growth is at least one and half times and in certain cases even more than two times. For example, in Rajasthan the growth is 37 per cent, while the company is growing at 14-15 per cent. But it is not because of any short term measure. We are not spending extra money, we are doing the hard yards of building the&amp;nbsp;distribution network by&amp;nbsp;making sure we create the right distributors, helping them sell our products and that again comes back to my point of having a strong brand.</news:description>

      <news:title>BW Marketing Whitebook Summit: 99% of disruption to happen in next 10 years: CEO, Raymond</news:title>
      <news:description>Today is an era where we need marketers to evolve, to transform, to enhance their roles not just doing brand marketing, but take mantle of leadership in inclusion of technology,” said Sanjay Behl, CEO, Raymond, as part of his keynote address at the BW Business World Marketing Whitebook summit in Bengaluru. Behl addressed a room full of audience on the topic ‘Marketing with Leadership, Inclusion, and Technology’. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In his opening remark Behl said, “Things are changing yet they are the same. Customisation, personalisation, uniqueness - these used to be there 50 years ago and it is there even today, may be the ‘how’ of that has changed, but the ‘what’ of that is pretty much the same. If we could decode the change then it’s possible we can ride on the change. In a very meaningful way to create disruptive value for our brands.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Behl’s keynote address was focussed on how a marketer is going to calibrate itself differently into leadership, how they are going to calibrate themselves to inclusion and dimension, and the role of technology in the life of the consumer and how the marketer or brands need to embrace this technology?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Television became the first real mode of revolution in mode of entertainment not just in India but across the world, starting in 60s, 70s it became the household mode of entertainment, to an extent that India became the most television consuming countries in the world. Even today India is No. 2 to Brazil which consumes three and half hours of television viewing time every day,” said Behl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Behl said that, today we have over supply of products and choices have gone up. In order to substantiate the fact, he elaborated with examples of apparels and shampoo brands in the country. He continued, “In an oversupply situation you can never make money on maturity of any brand because there is going to be commoditisation and glut. Product life cycle are compressing.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explaining on today’s marketer’s job, Behl said, “Fundamentally the basic model of creating value today is shifted dramatically because consumer has evolved rapidly and betting on that has changed the whole paradigm of how we market with brand effectively. At core level a marketer job is to identify needs and fulfil them.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Since time immemorial, in recorded history, human productivity has always been linear. Machines gave dramatic rise to productivity in the last 200 years, but again very linear. Fundamental change happened when Information Technology got integrated. That was the crux which took away the linear ability of a cognitive human mind. The whole paradigm of management changed, the best of the company which was built on the linear industrial revolution failed because they couldn’t comprehend,” said Behl.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Exponential growth is a paradigm of compounding which a human brain does not understand,” added Behl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking on digitisation Behl said, “The problem with digitisation is that it’s disruptive in first few years and that is the reason why human minds fail to understand the meaning of it. 99 per cent of the disruption is going to happen in the next 10 years,” said Behl. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Behl said that Scarcity is contextual, and there is going to be abundance of everything. Everything will be virtual and de-centralised, and the world is going to be a better place.</news:description>

      <news:title>Watch: There is no one way to define great KPI: Sidharth Gowda, Zirca Digital Solutions</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Initiative by Bloomberg Quint &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Content marketing has changed the dynamics of marketing strategy. Marketers are becoming increasingly committed to this channel. But when it comes to decoding the success formula it still seems to be a mystery. Sidharth Gowda, Strategy Head, Zirca Digital Solutions, listed out the key aspects of a good content marketing strategy and performance indicators for successful campaigns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the key aspects of a good content marketing strategy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;What works is how you are going to plan your creation. For example we have this framework called ‘Create, Curate and Collaborate.’ It gives you a sense of what the brand needs to create, curate from the existing sources to engage social media followers or collaborate with influencers and publishers who themselves create content. It helps a brand plan out the kind of content they need to invest in and plan for it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another part of good content strategy would be the understanding of the mainline strategy. Content always needs to be complemented with the existing campaigns that are happening on outdoor, print or even television.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on the detailed content-marketing strategy required for the success of most organisations?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s extremely critical these days. When was the last time we interacted with transactional media. We interact with conversational media that helps us think differently and inspires us. That’s what brands need to understand. And, they are doing that. They understand the fact that audiences are moving beyond transactional media. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are content creators who are enabling brands to be a part of those conversations. So definitely content creation and content amplification are going to be the future. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the key performance indicators for a successful content marketing campaign?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It could be the number of searches the brand has created, followers on your social media page has created, the likes your videos have got, the kind of traffic coming on to your website, It is not as linear as many brands think. It’s not about getting the right kind of likes; it’s about the conversation your boosted posts are getting. It needs to drive sales also. It’s a mixture of hard and soft measures. Also looking at it holistically there is not one measure that defines great KPI. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does content marketing help to reduce overall marketing costs?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Content marketing can definitely reduce overall marketing costs. When we look at the more successful lead-generation campaigns people share their information which they hold very closely to their heart only when there is an exchange of value. When we create infographic, great content that’s gated, that is when people don’t mind sharing the information in exchange for value that we created. That’s a great way to reduce marketing cost because wastage is being reduced but creating great value in terms of content.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ZzZ0I-S6-k" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>How Motorola set an example for product launch on Twitter</news:title>
      <news:description>Hey marketer, is Twitter part of your product launch strategy?  No? Then you may want to rethink how you use Twitter to launch a product or offer. In June, Motorola leveraged Twitter for the launch of MotoG6 and MotoG6Play, seeing very healthy engagement rates and reach. For the launch, Motorola chose to utilise the various avenues for promotion on Twitter like Live, and&amp;nbsp;RT/Heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter has become&amp;nbsp;the right place to launch a product,&amp;nbsp;especially for technology brands. Motorola went for&amp;nbsp;Twitter because a lot of smartphone enthusiasts use the platform. Also, the brand wanted to target the Gen Z audience that hangs out on Twitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a duration of two weeks from May 20 to June 6, 2018, Motorola used Twitter to build anticipation, launch and re-engage with users post&amp;nbsp;launch. “We recognise Twitter as the key platform where our audience goes to know about everything that is new and happening.&amp;nbsp;And this strategic partnership helped us leverage the platform and its unique formats to deliver a clutter-breaking and holistic launch experience,” said Simran Dhindsa, Media &amp;amp; Digital Marketing Head, Motorola India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To maximize views and awareness about the new product, Motorola needed to drive opt-ins for the live event before the launch day. To do so, the official Twitter handle of Motorola India @motorolaindia encouraged fans to engage with the pre-launch Tweet in the form of a RT or like to receive personalised reminder Tweets when the livestream starts. This engagement activity played out well for @motorolaindia, with the Tweet receiving close to 25K Likes and 397K video views.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the day of the launch, @motorolaindia notified the opt-in users about the livestream. When the product went on sale later at midnight, a follow-up notification/reminder was sent to the entire opt-in base to complete the loop. &lt;br&gt;The four-hour-long launch event featured non-stop entertainment by six artists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We brought together entertainers from different passion points for our users, i.e. music, technology, art and dance, and put together an elaborate and engaging launch event,” said Simran Dhindsa, Media &amp;amp; Digital Marketing Head, Motorola India. This made Motorola the first brand to directly partner with Twitter to amplify the launch event by leveraging Custom Livestream on the platform. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Singer Jasleen Royal, acapella group Raaga Trippin, tech experts Rajiv Makhni and Abhishek Baxi, and rap and street dance group Dharavi Rocks were some of the performers at the launch event. The event was hosted by popular anchor and Bollywood actor Maniesh Paul. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The visibility of the livestream on Twitter was increased by owning the First View Trend for the day and through Twitter Search. The campaign was further supported through promotions of the livestream which boosted the overall performance and helped deliver over 370K video views.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;No launch is complete without an emoji! To add colour to conversations around the #motog6 launch, Motorola and Twitter came up with a custom Twitter emoji that was triggered by hashtags #motog6, #motog6play, #motog6launch and #hellomoto.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this launch Twitter and Motorola set the best practices for a Twitter product launch. Live Video was a win for the brand because as the popularity of video continues, an increasing number of people are looking for different formats of video. Building excitement prior to the launch with RT to remind increased the chances of users watching the live event. Using a Promoted Trend helped unify the campaign and ensured the omnipresence of communication about the motog6 on the launch day. The brand also engaged with people in the post-event phase to close the loop. The video replay strategy was used to inform users about the new launch event after the event, to cater to an increased audience base. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Numbers say it all: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;•  Over 27K Likes/RTs driven before the launch to send reminders to watch the event&lt;br&gt;•  Whopping +370K views for the livestream of #motog6launch &lt;br&gt;•  57K account and hashtag mentions (1325% growth in mentions compared to pre-event)&lt;br&gt;• Industry benchmarks set&amp;nbsp;by achieving an engagement rate of 5% on the first view trend</news:description>

      <news:title>Cadbury partners with Pratham Education Foundation for ‘The wrapper that gives’ initiative&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>Cadbury Dairy Milk recently&amp;nbsp;announced the launch of a new campaign ‘Kuch Achha Ho Jaaye, Kuch Meetha Ho Jaaye’. The campaign aims to put a spotlight on the small acts of goodness that people do. As part of this campaign, Cadbury Dairy Milk has introduced a unique social initiative called ‘The wrapper that gives’. The initiative has been conceptualised by Mondelez India &amp;amp; Ogilvy and being activated in association with Reliance Jio and Pratham Education Foundation. Pratham is an internationally acclaimed award-winning NGO that works for the welfare and education of children across India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a country like India, with so many people and with less resources, being generous might seem like an impossible task. But with a closer look at Indians, one will see that generosity is inherent in all of us and come the opportunity, it shines through for all to see. Mondelez India spotted an opportunity in education. While most school kids in cities are familiar and learn with the internet, their rural counterparts do not enjoy the same facilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This campaign aims at celebrating the generous instinct in everyone, showcasing as to how such moments go on to strengthen human relationships. Through this initiative we now want to explore the theme of Achhai (goodness), building on the strong proposition of ‘Kuch Meetha Ho Jaaye’. We are absolutely thrilled to partner with Pratham Education Foundation, that has been doing some great work in the space of education for children. This initiative will truly help us spread the goodness around,” said Anil Viswanathan, Director - Marketing (Chocolates), Mondelez India commenting on the initiative.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With ‘The Wrapper that Gives’, Cadbury Dairy Milk looks at providing an opportunity to consumers to participate in the Generosity campaign. Consumer can unlock 1 GB data by clicking a photo of an empty wrapper of a Cadbury Dairy Milk. At the time of redemption, consumers are given an option to either keep the data for themselves or donate to Pratham Education Foundation so that they can make restricted, useful and safe access to the Internet possible for children in rural communities, rightfully carrying forward the spirit of generosity. The wrapper thus becomes the currency of generosity that enables millions of consumers to partake in the movement of generosity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Pratham is committed to provide learning opportunities to children in rural India. We are exploring effective use of technology in learning process, through a large scale digital intervention. Safe and education focused internet access provides the children a chance to explore a new world of learning opportunities. We are happy to partner with Mondelez India in their quest to spread goodness” said Madhav Chavan, Co-founder Pratham Education Foundation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign went live in India on Teachers Day, September 5, 2018 and will be hosted on the MyJio app for the period of 4 weeks. The offer will be available for Jio subscribers only. Once the campaign is over, the donated data will be passed on to Pratham Education Foundation, who will ensure that the collected data reaches the right schools to carry out the internet enabled learning activities among children. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the video here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Star Sports launches campaign for sixth season of VIVO Pro Kabaddi</news:title>
      <news:description>Star Sports has&amp;nbsp;announced the launch of the national campaign for season VI of VIVO PKL. The campaign speaks the language of Indianess, bravery and fitness, that is core to kabaddi. The truly Indian sport epitomises bravery, when a raider enters the court to challenge seven opposition players. It makes a strong statement that only the fittest can conquer and the campaign brings to the forefront these attributes that are intrinsic to the sport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In India, kabaddi has been a great childhood sport, however, professionally it is no child’s play. Arising from this insight, the creative adaptation of the campaign ‘Bachpan Ka Khel Hai, Bacchao Ka Nahin’ builds on the key insight that the homegrown sport is a part of our collective childhood, a local sport we played as kids in every nook and corner, however, to play at VIVO PKL you need to be the best.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign film depicts the insight with impeccable cinematic display, portraying the daily regime followed by players and the tireless hours that go into training, to excel on the mat. Every player that approaches the mat trains differently, the film opens with Pardeep Narwal who is seen running and then moves into other players Rishank Deavdiga, Anup Kumar and Monu Goyat who are training their best to prove themselves this season. The players through the film depict the sheer dedication, skill, physical and mental grind that goes into playing the sport.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the launch of the campaign for the sixth season of VIVO Pro Kabaddi, a Star Sports spokesperson, said, “VIVO Pro Kabaddi has taken a homegrown sport to new heights of fervour and popularity. The Season VI campaign, focuses on the skill, dedication and rigour required to play the sport. Kabaddi is tough and played by some of the bravest and fittest athletes today. The film takes you through their everyday journey as they prepare for the upcoming season.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The category defining sporting league has transformed kabaddi in India, raking in record viewership figures and laying the groundwork for the phoenix like rise of India’s home-grown sport across the globe. With the onset of Season VI, VIVO Pro Kabaddi is all set to get bigger, better and more engaging than ever before. Beginning in early October, the league will travel across 13 host cities and will culminate in Mumbai. The 12 teams have been divided into 2 zones of 6 teams each, where each of them will be playing 15 intra zone and 7 inter- zone matches prior to the play offs. The play offs stage will comprise of 3 action-packed qualifiers and 2 eliminators scheduled to take place in Kochi and Mumbai. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Suicide Prevention India Foundation raises awareness with #GiveSubtitlesToSuicide campaign</news:title>
      <news:description>With the aim to mark ‘World Suicide Prevention Week’, Suicide Prevention India Foundation, an NGO which works towards creating awareness about suicide prevention and WATConsult, the digital and social media agency from Dentsu Aegis Network, launched a campaign, ‘#GiveSubtitlesToSuicide’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) suicide is an emerging and a serious public health issue in our country. The most vulnerable and affected age group is between 15-29 years. The suicide mortality rate per 100,000 population in India is 15.7 while the global average is 10.7.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign focuses on the importance of identifying suicidal signs among those close to us, as most of the people fail to identify these signs, while some who understand, don't know how to deal with them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536980137_NOPzF6_Give-Subtitles-to-Suicide_2.jpg" style="width:443px;height:626px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Launched digitally, the campaign leverages the popular 'subtitles' feature on YouTube and Facebook. The campaign video revolves around the life of 5 college friends, has to be watched twice, first without and then with subtitles. When watched with subtitles, it showcases the fact that how some obvious suicidal signs get overlooked unintentionally and lead to suicide.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The agency also created a website to promote the ‘QPR Gatekeeper Training Program’ by Suicide Prevention Foundation India that trains a person to identify people at the risk of suicide by recognizing early signs, providing necessary intervention and access to mental health services. The NGO will also be conducting offline activities with various colleges to create awareness and educate students about the programme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rajiv Dingra, Founder and CEO, WATConsult commented, “As per the reports and statistics, suicide has been increasing at an alarming rate. We wanted to not only create awareness, but also provide support to the people in need; before it’s too late. We are glad to partner with Suicide Prevention India Foundation and urge people to sign up for the QPR Gatekeeper Training Programme that helps identify early signs of suicide, take corrective action and save lives.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536980147_z2cHdY_Give-Subtitles-to-Suicide_3.jpg" style="width:443px;height:626px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nelson Vinod Moses, Suicide Prevention India Foundation said, “Student suicides have gone up 52 per cent between 2007 and 2016. We wanted to throw the spotlight on how a community-based approach involving the Gatekeeper program can lead to more awareness, increased help-seeking and reduction in suicides. All of us can play a role in preventing suicides, all we need is the training to recognize signs, make interventions, and help them get the required help. We have a tie-up with US-based QPR Institute, the world leader in suicide prevention training to market their suicide prevention training program in India.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adding further he said, “The concept that we are exploring is simple but very powerful. Those with suicide ideation give out signs or talk about it, either directly or indirectly to a friend, classmate, family member, or colleague. But most of us are unable to pick up these signs, and even if we are told directly that the person is contemplating suicide, we don't have the necessary knowledge or skills to be able to deal with someone who's suicidal. #GiveSubtitlesToSuicide is about learning how to pick up signs of suicide, respond with kindness and concern, persuade those who are depressed or suicidal to get help, and then refer them to a place or person where they can get that help. All it takes is 60 minutes of Gatekeeper training to help someone who's feeling suicidal and potentially saving a life."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign is also being supported by MissMalini, an Indian digital influencer, TV host, entrepreneur and best-selling author, who launched the campaign on her social media pages and has been creating a buzz on her digital portal MissMalini.com.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indraprastha College for Women, University of Delhi, supports this campaign under its Mental Health Awareness initiative, and has made its premises available for shooting this film. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Quint Hindi and Google India present 'Bol: Love Your Bhasha'</news:title>
      <news:description>Quint Hindi (&lt;a href="https://hindi.thequint.com"&gt;hindi.thequint.com&lt;/a&gt;), a leading Hindi digital news platform, along with Google India, is hosting an event to celebrate the explosion of Indian languages on the internet. “Bol: Love Your Bhasha” is a day long event to be held on 18th September 2018 in New Delhi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The event will consist of panel discussions, with the objective of highlighting the potential of language diversity on the internet in India. The event will be graced by Mr. Nitin Gadkari, the Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways and distinguished guests such as, Rajan Anandan, Vice President, Google, India; Arvind Pani, Co-Founder and CEO of Reverie Language Technologies; Anant Goenka, Executive Director, The Indian Express Group; Virendra Gupta, Founder and CEO of Daily Hunt and Raghav Bahl, Founder, Quintillion Media. These discussions will also be interspersed with performances by Sonam Kalra of the Sufi Gospel Project. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indian language internet users in India are at 234 million and have already overtaken the number of English users (175 million). Encouraged by a decline in smartphone and data prices, Indian language users are expected to account for nearly 75 per cent of India’s internet user base by 2021.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These are stunning figures, especially for a country with the second-largest number of internet users in the world. The conversation is now not on why businesses must enter the non-English user market, but how. “Bol” aims to answer this question by bringing together the brightest minds in tech, business, media and policy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the need for such an event, Raghav Bahl, Founder, Quintillion Media, said “ The explosion of Indian languages in the years to come is estimated to be so significant that it will be impossible for all stakeholders involved to ignore it. This is why an event like Bol is essential to roadmap the future.”</news:description>

      <news:title>DCMN wins media mandate for Truecaller </news:title>
      <news:description>DCMN India has bagged the media mandate for communications app Truecaller. The account was won following a multi-agency pitch that involved several big agencies. The mandate includes managing the company’s TV media duties across different markets and campaign tracking using DCMN’s proprietary TV attribution technology, DC Analytics, the agency said in a statement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pitch process was held in New Delhi and the account will be handled by DCMN’s Gurgaon office. The business will be led by Bindu Balakrishnan, Country Head, DCMN India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Truecaller is all set to launch its new TV campaign, which aims to communicate its new features that positions it beyond just a caller ID app. The app integrated video calling, instant messaging and even payments in March last year. The features have been embedded in the app to take into account the demands of a new-age user and over the last year, audiences have responded well to the updates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about it, Manan Shah, Director Marketing - India, Truecaller, said, “Over 150 million people use Truecaller in India alone, primarily to know who is calling. Over the last year, Truecaller has transformed into a complete communication suite with video calling, a unique instant messaging utility called Flash and integrated UPI based payments and banking features. This is a story worth telling to our users so that they can find all these features in their most-loved app, without the need to use multiple apps.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During the pitch process, the synergies between DCMN India and Truecaller became apparent because Truecaller understood the importance of TV tracking, a unique offering from DCMN in the Indian market, the statement mentioned.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the help of its flagship tool DC Analytics, DCMN India will analyse how consumers are using these top-end features of the Truecaller app in real-time across different locations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the association, Balakrishnan said, “I am very excited about this partnership as I am a Truecaller user myself. The idea of integrating video calling, payment and instant messaging into the app solves multiple purposes for any consumer. While awareness and downloads are already high, the brand is now looking at performance metrics as its main KPI for the upcoming TV campaign. Our strength lies in the experience we have in performance media marketing. DCMN’s performance approach includes data-driven media planning and tracking the direct response at a TV spot level with our proprietary TV attribution tool. We are looking at running a highly optimized media campaign for Truecaller.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Using DC Analytics, DCMN India will track the growth and usage of the new features on the app once the campaign is launched. With the real time learnings, we will help Truecaller optimise its media spend and reach a larger audience. Our tracking tool is a unique offering to the Indian market,” Balakrishnan added.</news:description>

      <news:title>Apollo Alpha’s campaign takes thrill of riding to new level</news:title>
      <news:description>Apollo Tyres has added another offering to its portfolio with the launch of Alpha, a steel radial motorcycle tyre. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first commercial for Alpha, created by J Walter Thompson, showcases how with Alpha, one can take the thrill of riding to the next level, with a clutter-breaking execution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ankur Thakur, Category Head, two-wheeler and passenger car segment, Apollo Tyres, said, “This steel radial offering is a unique product as it offers high speed stability and cornering stability and with less wear and tear and is ideal for some of the popular models in the 200 cc + segment. With Apollo Alpha, we hope to significantly grow our market share in the motorcycle radial tyre segment.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Joy Chauhan, Managing Partner, J Walter Thompson, Delhi, said, “The adrenalin rush of speed, the exhilaration of a skilful cornering – any true blue biker will tell you that it’s a rare thrill. He’ll also tell you that a powerful bike isn’t enough, if the tyre can't keep up. But the cutting edge technology from Apollo Alpha can take the riding thrill to another level. To connect with this biker though, the content needed to weave a world that he finds fascinating; to visualize the possibilities, to be thrills on a screen.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sambit Mohanty, National Creative Director, J Walter Thompson, said, "If your bike's a beast, what would it ride on? This simple insight helped us craft our latest blockbuster for Apollo Tyres. Our 'Beast' is a machine-animal hybrid imagined straight out of the pages of a hellish graphic novel (or an edge-of-the-seat Hollywood production) and it's been unleashed to ride fast and hard on Apollo Alpha Radials without losing its grip ever. Perfect to rev up your beast and add more thrill to your ride!" &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvH42_45ZKg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Mathrubhumi Group launches new real estate portal- findhome.com</news:title>
      <news:description>Mathrubhumi, Kerala’s media conglomerate has launched an online real estate platform &lt;a href="https://findhome.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;findhome.com&lt;/a&gt;, for global Malayalees to access a home anywhere, anytime. The online portal was launched by M P Veerendra Kumar, Chairman &amp;amp; Managing Director, Mathrubhumi Group, along with Mathrubhumi officials.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The venture marks one more milestone in digital initiative of Mathrubhumi. Consumers can rent/lease, buy, and sell a wide variety of property ranging from residential properties, commercial buildings, and many more, which can be listed for free on &lt;a href="https://findhome.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;findhome.com&lt;/a&gt;. Designed in a completely user-friendly manner, the portal enables users to find properties of their choice in the fastest and easiest way. As an interactive platform this portal is also available in Android and iOS applications in mobile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536918277_XRtECG_MP-Veerendra-Kumar-launching-the-real-estate-website-findhome.jpg" style="width:400px;height:301px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;MP Veerendra Kumar, Chairman &amp;amp; Managing Director, Mathrubhumi Group during the launch of the new website &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;The newly designed logo of &lt;a href="https://findhome.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;findhome.com&lt;/a&gt;, combines simplicity, elegance and an element of familiar warmth. The logo uses a pair of sparrows almost like ‘brand ambassadors’ resembling the fond memories of our childhood, in which sparrows flew in our homes and got busy looking for food or searching for spaces to build their nest. The correlation between nests and sparrows is so strong, it lends itself beautifully to a portal specialised in dwellings. The primary colour of yellow and white perfectly balance the brown of the sparrows and reflects optimism and dynamism, logo that is truly ‘ready to fly’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the launch, MP Veerendra Kumar said “Mathrubhumi has been the bedrock of trust and an integral part of Kerala for the last 9 decades. &lt;a href="https://Findhome.com" rel="nofollow"&gt;Findhome.com&lt;/a&gt;, Mathrubhumi’ s latest digital venture, will help every Malayalee understand the new trends and changes taking place in Kerala's real estate industry and act as a smarter tool for buying, renting and selling properties everywhere in the state”.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>YouTube Testing Vertical Ads</news:title>
      <news:description>More than 70 per cent of YouTube watch time happens on mobile devices, globally. To engage viewers effectively with TrueView and Universal App campaigns, YouTube has adapted to their viewing behaviours and created a variety of different video ads – including square and vertical videos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YouTube will launch vertical video ads to provide a more seamless mobile experience for viewers. With vertical video ads for Universal App and TrueView campaigns on YouTube, you can upload a vertical video, and when a viewer sees the ad on their mobile device, the player will expand based on the dimensions of the video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For maximum Brand Lift impact, vertical video ads provide a big, beautiful canvas to deliver messages on mobile and allow engagement with customers in a way that fits their viewing preferences. They also complement horizontal videos. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hyundai recently took YouTube vertical video ads for test drive, using the feature in combination with their horizontal video assets to introduce the world to an all new SUV model. The result: a 33 per cent lift in brand awareness and a nearly 12 per cent lift in consideration.</news:description>

      <news:title>Marketing communications firm Proact forays into US market</news:title>
      <news:description>Proact Brandcomm, a marketing and communications consulting firm, has made&amp;nbsp;its entry in&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;United States of America with a&amp;nbsp;presence in Boston city in the state of Massachusetts. It recently entered its 6th year of operations. Speaking to media about its expansion plans, Ritu Kant Ojha said, "We are ecstatic, emotional and nervous all at the same time. It is being possible only through the love and trust of our clients which helped us sustain and grow in a tough market."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Proact has clients across technology, financial services, infrastructure and lifestyle. It has worked with financial services giant Aditya Birla Capital,&amp;nbsp;asset management company ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, some of the leading FinTech startups such as&amp;nbsp;BigDecisions-a NewsCorp owned brand, one of&amp;nbsp;Asia's largest healthcare focussed private equity firms, Quadria Capital, Finance Buddha and Lenddo, technology firms such as&amp;nbsp;Dreamorbit and Leadsquared, and launched and managed prestigious Smart Cities Council in India among several other marquee names.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Foray into a more matured market like America was the next logical step for us. The discussions  with some of our prospective clients based in New York and Boston have been quite exciting.  It also allows us to monetise our market research, marketing communications, branded content and image consulting capabilities. A separate entity in US is being formed with the same brand name. Our presence in US will give massive edge to our clients in India and vice-versa as we can now bring-in cost efficiency," said Ojha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A former business journalist and columnist, Ojha has worked with CNBC TV18, Bloomberg TV, The Indian Express and StarNews (now ABP News) for over 12 years before becoming an entrepreneur. The entrepreneurial journey was not easy, he says. "It all started with one client and&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;single employee and for the&amp;nbsp;next 12 months we had no other client. The second client came along only in the 13th month and third client in the 18th month. It was a tough time. However, as the word spread about our services, referrals started coming-in and by the end of 24 months we had 15 clients, and had crossed 25 clients with revenues of Rs 1crore, by the third year."&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Managing different vendors is a major issue for most corporate communications and marketing teams. Proact has built business around solving this issue by offering vernacular content, public relations, video production and digital marketing under single umbrella.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Proact runs a vernacular media platform wenus.in, focussed on women, and wahlife.in, a healthcare focussed blog along with a content production arm, ChaturMonkey. "In-house capabilities to offer content, marketing solutions and public relations has allowed us to offer premium services under one umbrella at an affordable cost. This also has allowed us to consult our clients beyond media relations," said Ojha.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wishing Proact&amp;nbsp;good luck,&amp;nbsp;  Rajiv Jamkhedkar, former MD &amp;amp; CEO of AEGON Religare Life Insurance &amp;amp; co-founder of Serengeti Ventures,&amp;nbsp;said, "Proact team has been working closely with us for the last three&amp;nbsp;years. Instead of just mundane press releases, quotes and bytes in media, they engaged with us on a business consulting level. Connecting the dots across marketing, public relations and content is not an easy task and entails tons of hard work in understanding a client's business. That in fact separates Ritu Kant's team from others. Their team is a delight to work with. We at Serengeti Ventures wish Proact many more milestones."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the strategic partners of Proact, Philippe Racine, a serial tech entrepreneur and Founder of Montreal based AI powered marketing intelligence firm Texteur, said, "Proact has been our trusted partner in India. I am thrilled to know they will have operations in US. We would extend all support to their local team."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Congratulating Proact Brandcomm over the expansion, Sunil Thakur, MD of&amp;nbsp;Quadria Capital - said, "Healthcare industry is diverse, complex and in most markets, highly specialised. The best part about Proact team is its willingness to get into the details and ability to understand the intricacies of the sector. Ritu Kant is meticulous in his approach and walks that extra mile to deliver beyond expectations. This tenet will help his team do very well in a market like US."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ojha&amp;nbsp;has also&amp;nbsp;produced and directed two short films on personal finance which crossed 5 lakh views across social media. A web-series "Zindagi-Disrupt" is due for release in early 2019.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;"Ritu Kant brings-in fresh perspective on marketing and is quite abreast with what is happening in Finance &amp;amp; Technology. (He is) completely trustworthy and cool headed,&amp;nbsp;a pleasure to work with as a consultant. He will do very well in a market like the&amp;nbsp;US," said&amp;nbsp;Parth Pande, ex-Citibanker and co-founder &amp;amp; CEO of Finance Buddha.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"In the last 10 years that I have known Ritu Kant, first as financial journalist and then leading a marketing communications firm, he came across as a fun-guy who is honest, well-networked and very sincere towards his work. He has been working with me for the last two years over growth consulting and marketing and the energy he brings to the table is envious. In a short span, he has created a long list of happy clients who are his brand ambassadors now. US is a great market to be in for phase 2 of Proact," said one of India's leading equity market experts, Ambareesh Baliga. &lt;/div&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Rahul Vira spends weekends bonding with friends and cooking for family  </news:title>
      <news:description>Being the CEO of a big brand is no mean feat. A barrage of work, reams of calls, tons of emails and a plethora of tasks to complete. And so, weekends come&amp;nbsp;as a respite from the gruelling work week, giving the much-needed dose of rest and recreation. For Rahul Vira, CEO, Skechers South Asia Pvt. Ltd, weekends are about sampling different cuisines, catch-up time with friends and more.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Read on...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a typical weekend you will find me... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Cooking, chilling or meeting friends &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My idea of relaxing is... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I’m a foodie. I love trying different cuisines. There is a new Brazilian restaurant in Mumbai. I’m planning to check out the vegetarian options it has in store for me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One vice I cannot do without... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;I don’t know if it’s a vice, but getting up early and going for running, walking or gyming. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love staycation/adventure... &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;There was a time when I loved adventures, but now with kids and all, I opt for staycations. But given a chance to add in a little bit of adventure, I’ll definitely do that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I confess, I am a...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Passionate person. I give my everything to any task that I take up. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I spend me-time on...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Whatever relaxes me; be it going to the garden with kids or catching up on a good movie.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last show I binge watched...&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Rocky Series&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can cook a mean... to save my life&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Middle-eastern cuisine. My father once told me if you learn to cook, you’ll never have to starve or be dependent on anyone. From then on, I’ve inculcated this habit.</news:description>

      <news:title>BW Marketing Whitebook Launch: Men shop a lot more secretly, Srinivas Rao, Lifestyle</news:title>
      <news:description>As Indian consumers look to upscale, premiumize and reach out for better options, how can marketers tap on the massive headroom for growth? This was answered by industry experts at BW Businessworld’s Marketing Whitebook Launch in Bengaluru.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The panel included Ankita Bajaj Shankar, Marketing Lead, VANS India; Paul Ruban, Head of GTM (Go-To- Market), Fossil India; Santhosh NS, Marketing Head, Fujitsu; and Srinivas Rao, Sr Vice President Marketing, Lifestyle. The panel discussion was moderated by Sunder Madakshira, Head-Marketing, Adobe India.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madakshira in his opening remark said, “I think what goes in the mind of marketers is what is going in the mind of consumers. We are here to discuss the changing taste of Indian consumer, which was favourite topic years back and it will remain as one of the enigmatic topics in the field of marketing. It is very interesting and very vast topic.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madakshira started the panel discussion by asking the brands to talk about the biggest changes they have seen in their consumers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Srinivas said, “I will allude to the BCG report called New Indian, it talks about how incomes are rapidly rising and how certain category consumption becomes non-linear after a certain point. The category which I represent, Lifestyle which involves fashion apparels, footwear, sunglasses, and watches. These belong to this category where beyond a point the consumption for these categories become non-linear.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He continued, “Specific change we are witnessing contrary to common perception that women shop a lot, now men shop a lot more secretly.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bajaj Shankar said, “What we are seeing as global trend buying behaviour, Unisex is a trend globally and that is reflected in India as well. Lines are blurring between having product specifically for a certain gender, there are more and more demand for apparel or footwear which can reflect personal style, your preferences. We are moving towards having Unisex products propositions for consumers in India.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the changes in the market Ruban said, “Shopping is being re-invented. The data we received from our partners my consumer profile is entirely different when we look into digital consumers. We as marketers are trying to connect to consumers."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"India being large country with different people of different income levels we see different changes in consumer behaviour. Conversations with the consumers is changing now and that gives us a lot of insight," said Santhosh. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Which brands have done exceptional job of understanding its consumers other than yours, asked Madakshira to the panellists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rao said, “Adidas. Whatever they have done in half decade, they have understood the pulse of the youth not just one country but across the globe. If you need to study marketing, follow brand Adidas, it is just like university.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Ruban, it was brand Puma. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Santhosh said, “Apple’s customer category was constant, they didn’t try to get other category of customers. Another brand is Cult, the way they have used digital media to reach to the people is commendable.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“If I have to name one brand it is Amazon. In terms of marketing communication, nothing beats Amazon. Every communication they come up with is brilliant in terms of reaching the heart of the Indian consumer,” said Bajaj Shankar.</news:description>

      <news:title>Brick or Click strategy: Is co-existence the way forward?</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;It appeared that a while ago, the e-commerce boom in India was here to conclude &#13;
  the popularity of offline retail stores. e-tailing, once a threat to the brick &#13;
  and mortar retailers, is now slowly but surely setting up offline stores to &#13;
  expand its presence. With users being at the center of everything, it seems &#13;
  as though customers want to reap benefits of both a touch and feel shopping &#13;
  experience as well as a one-stop-shop platform accompanied by the convenience &#13;
  of home delivery. The key question remains whether it is brick or click which &#13;
  will dominate in the long run or is it about building a hybrid retail model &#13;
  that has the best of both the online &amp;amp; offline worlds for today’s customer.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  exchange4media spoke to brands in both e-commerce &amp;amp; retail chains to find &#13;
  out their views on an online vs offline marketing strategy.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pepperfry: Will advertise where my user is&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/41Gh4YT1xnQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;Digital-first brands such as Pepperfry, Myntra, Nyka, Urban Ladder and Health &#13;
  Kart are tuning into growing their physical footprints in ways traditional retailers &#13;
  haven’t yet imagined. The online furniture retail store Pepperfry is one such &#13;
  brand which adds to the experience of an online retailer by showcasing a curated &#13;
  range of furniture from its online collection. This helps consumers get a first-hand &#13;
  feel and understanding of how the furniture will actually look when placed at &#13;
  home. Speaking to exchange4media, Ambareesh Murty, Founder of Pepperfry, elaborated &#13;
  on the reasons behind adopting the offline advertising medium of Studio Pepperfry. &#13;
  He said, “It is the duty of every business to ensure that it is present wherever &#13;
  the customer wants it to be. My customer is sometimes online, at times offline &#13;
  and then on mobile sometimes. I will engage with my consumers as per the platform &#13;
  they access.” This clearly proves that the merger of online and offline is imminent &#13;
  as the customer wants the best of both worlds.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Online going offline&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  After a successful 5-year online stint, Falguni Nayyar’s Nykaa has also expanded &#13;
  their footing offline with an objective of being an Omni-channel destination &#13;
  in the beauty and skincare segment for its customers. Recently, Nykaa launched &#13;
  yet another brick-and-mortar store in Delhi at the Chanakya Mall by the DLF &#13;
  Group, adding to the existing tally of 20 stores in India. Online fashion portal &#13;
  Myntra too is looking forward to expanding on its current offline presence by &#13;
  increasing its brick-and-mortar store count, as it would help them strengthen &#13;
  the brand and further leverage their brand value. It seems as though, the once &#13;
  native-only online players are now trying to integrate various marketing-mix &#13;
  in order to provide their users with a seamless online-to-offline experience.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mzlr56d6vko" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Timing matters&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  With the rise of online entities wanting to undergo a multi-channel experience, &#13;
  a few of the advertisers and marketers exchange4media spoke to had a different &#13;
  perspective to share. With respect to online brands some experts were of the &#13;
  opinion that those dealing with e-commerce should consider moving into high &#13;
  street markets only after cementing a strong and profitable market position &#13;
  within the online industry. This would help them negotiate better with retail &#13;
  partners in order to include their wares in the stores. Amazon’s India story &#13;
  is a shining example of e-commerce success which now aims at leveraging the &#13;
  offline presence of several retail stores across India to augment its last mile &#13;
  delivery network, this under the Amazon Easy umbrella, an India-specific innovation.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon India’s story&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  Speaking to exchange4media, an Amazon India spokesperson said that their Amazon &#13;
  Easy initiative will help them experiment with physical retail even better. &#13;
  Through this channel they are able to equip offline partner stores with training &#13;
  materials such as browsing and navigation on Amazon.in which will further help &#13;
  customers set up Amazon accounts, make payments, answer status-delivery related &#13;
  queries and request refunds and returns if need be. Customers can also walk &#13;
  in to the neighbourhood Amazon Easy store for assistance while shopping on Amazon.in &#13;
  and choose to pay with cash on delivery or swipe their cards at the store itself &#13;
  while placing orders. “Amazon’s assisted shopping for users which pans across &#13;
  14,000 stores currently also opens up self employment and other job opportunities &#13;
  for semi-skilled and partially skilled people," says the spokesperson.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Offline going online&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  On the other hand, we also have the once offline-only retailers speeding up &#13;
  in the race to keep track with online entities, taking competition to the next &#13;
  level. An example of such a deal is that of Walmart, which acquired a 77 per &#13;
  cent stake in online brand Flipkart, for $16 billion, making it perhaps the &#13;
  largest acquisition in the country. There is a bevy of foreign firms investing &#13;
  in India with the recent one being the Swedish furniture giant IKEA, which recently &#13;
  set up its first store in Hyderabad. The Swedish retailer also plans to open &#13;
  more stores in India by investing around Rs. 20,000 crore in the country.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&#13;

&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;IKEA in India&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  Speaking to exchange4media, Per Hornell, Head of Maharashtra Market, IKEA India, &#13;
  cited a few specific reasons behind their plans to go online even after a strong &#13;
  offline presence. Referring to the fast evolving e-tailing market in India, &#13;
  Hornell said that in addition to online, a brick-and-mortar concept would help &#13;
  IKEA to expand its reach with home furnishing offers at an affordable price &#13;
  for all. With changing consumption patterns, rising disposable incomes and the &#13;
  dining out culture, India’s retail landscape is thriving today and attracting &#13;
  significant investments. Hence, it is crucial for IKEA to invest in a tailored &#13;
  mix of sales channels such as, stores, online via web, mobile and pop-up stores, &#13;
  thereby being part of each of these markets and maximising reach, claims Hornell. &#13;
  So here again, the need of the hour is to collaborate the strengths of both &#13;
  mediums to make for a seamless experience for consumers.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the (Brick + Click) Model = A better fit&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  With the penetration of mobile devices and rapid technology adoption in India, &#13;
  consumers are resorting to varied consumption patterns, depending on their needs, &#13;
  inspiration and interests. With users taking to online shopping, offline retailers &#13;
  are innovating and going the extra mile for their users. While high street markets &#13;
  not only help brands boost their presence on ground, but also allows them to &#13;
  have an edge in logistics and distribution, online players come with a wider &#13;
  catalogue, better positioning and branding in the market, with a relatively &#13;
  frictionless customer experience to begin with. Keeping in mind what the industry &#13;
  experts have to say, it seems imperative that both online and offline players &#13;
  pull their weight and play to their full strengths and capabilities in the emerging &#13;
  Indian retail landscape.&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Watch: Consumer data is the new currency in new model marketplace: Akash Banerji, Voot</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Initiative by Bloomberg Quint &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;With time not only have the consumer or brands evolved, the marketing strategy too has changed but the rules of the game are still the same. The target audience, their needs, what they want to consume, the whole content marketing strategy revolves around the same. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Akash Banerji, Head Marketing and Partnerships, Viacom18 Digital Ventures- Voot in a conversation with exchange4media, shares his thoughts on content marketing strategy and why traditional form of advertising will remain the choice of masses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A detailed content marketing strategy is essential for the success of most organisation. Your thoughts?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The entire world has changed in last couple of years with the explosion of devices and with abundance of content pieces for the consumers. But what has fundamentally changed on the advertising front is that the traditional models for mass media market where an advertiser and brand would go out there and talk about how unique they are and how greatly they are going to change your life is no more relevant. Consumers now know their favourite brand that Google informs them at that point in time. Now in this new era, brands and advertisers have increasingly started combining data and technology with impeccable story telling not just to buy loyalty from consumers but to earn it every single time. Hence content marketing very clearly is the new forefront for advertisers trying to seek, to leverage, drive long term brand loyalty with the consumers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What according to you are the key aspects of a good content marketing strategy? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The further we go away from the old the more we realise that the rules of the games are still the same. Hence, even on the content marketing side the first biggest cornerstone is to know who your target audience is. And everything first and foremost needs to revolve around that because once you know who your target consumer is and their needs, your content needs to cater around that. Secondly, now with the explosion of the data, the consumer data has become the new currency in this new model marketplace. In this new world, fortunately or unfortunately, the only way you can win is to be strategically focused on the sweet spot where data, technology, audience and content meet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How media has evolved around content marketing, given increased consumer engagement and how brands are using this as a measurement medium.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brands have very clearly realised that the world of media has changed faster than any time in the history. We all are at some level, whether it's a platform or consumer we all are fighting a battle of attention, to win hearts and minds of the consumers. In that process, advertisers have realised that the only way to win that battle through a simple rule which is to create more riveting stories and rest everything else is pure noise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that traditional content marketing is being left out in the digital push?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Absolutely not, TV is not going to die anytime soon. TV penetration in this country is still hovering around 60-65 percent. TV very clearly continues to see, a massive growth in next few years because what they end up doing is delivering massive reach to a huge set of consumers. While the messages can be micro targeted which is corollary to what digital offers but for meaning to be established you need mass media and traditional form of advertising. Traditional form of mass media is not going to die.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-g5g48xwOCc" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Content studios under threat as agencies join the game?</news:title>
      <news:description>Content has become the latest battlefront for some digital agencies. Following the success of a number of partnerships between content studios/creators and brands, agencies are attempting to create the magic of content themselves. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In April this year, GroupM’s The Glitch launched a content division called The Flux. One division of The Flux is a content studio that addresses the long-term needs of the clients while the content lab vertical functions as an incubator for brands. Late last year, independent agency Foxymoron along with Famous Studios launched a content division that creates digital video solutions for brands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These in-house content labs/studios come with the promise of connecting brands to influencers, much like what MCNs and content studios are known to do. Over the years, with content becoming a bigger part of a company’s digital spend, brands are preferring to work with content creators but with agencies as the mediator. “While it is hard to put a number to it, the number of projects coming through agencies is increasing,” said the creative director of a leading digital content studio. He said that brands find the process more streamlined if done through an agency. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But that’s just half the story. Agencies are under a lot of pressure and spend a significant fraction of their time and efforts on pitches. In addition, briefs from retainer clients, which are higher than they used to be, are being lost to content studios. “Agencies see an opportunity here. They believe they know brands and their needs better and they have access to these clients. So they see it as the logical next step,” said the head of a content studio. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interview to exchange4media, Pooja Jauhari, CEO, The Glitch, had highlighted this point. Explaining the launch of The Flux, she had said, “Content has shied away thinking ‘Will the brand ruin my content?’ and brands feel ‘Hey, I want more of my brand in that content.’ We build brands and tie-up or work with content where the brand is right at the centre of it all as we create great stories.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is not just large agencies that are building in-house capabilities for content studios. Smaller agencies that function out of hole-in-the-wall establishments too have a small room with a studio setup where they shoot content for social media posts and the like. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is born out of the knowledge that content is ephemeral, particularly&amp;nbsp;digital content.&amp;nbsp;“Five years ago, brands saw digital as a place to make their presence felt with a website, Facebook page, Twitter account etc. Whereas now, brands have realised the need to engage with consumers online. The opportunity that has presented itself is the need to create content in a constant state,” says Advait Gupt - Founder &amp;amp; Managing Partner - Supari Studios. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither Gupt nor the two other content studio heads exchange4media spoke to saw the trend of agencies trying their hand at the content game as a threat. But they are cautious.&amp;nbsp;“It would be foolhardy to think that no one can be a substitute to the product I offer,” one content studio head said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While it is the agencies that are under threat on a number of fronts, content studios are cautious but confident about their position in the market. “The market is just opening up right now. It has not reached a state of hyper-competitiveness where we are worried about agencies eating into our business,” Gupt said.</news:description>

      <news:title>Sir Martin Sorrell unveils S4 Capital's stock market prospectus</news:title>
      <news:description>S4 Capital published a prospectus setting out its strategy for growth and a circular detailing the acquisition of S4Capital and convening a general meeting on 27 September, 2018 when it will begin trading on the London stock market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The almost 200 page prospectus offers an in-depth overview of the company’s plans, the opportunities it sees and the potential pitfalls identified since its launch after Sir Martin Sorrell’s departure from WPP. The front cover of the prospectus features an image of a Burning Man sculpture to signify regeneration and says the group’s ambition is: "To create a new era, new media solution, embracing data, content and technology, in an always-on environment for multi-national, regional and local clients and for millennial-driven digital brands."&amp;nbsp;The prospectus says that bypassing traditional ad agencies and taking on management consultants are two key areas of focus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On May 30, Derriston Capital announced the conditional acquisition of S4Capital Limited, a newly incorporated company which had recently completed a £51 million equity fund raise, of which Sorrell contributed £40 million with the balance of the funds coming from institutional and other investors. The deal meant a change in the company's corporate strategy into building a multi-national communication services business and a proposed name change to S4Capital plc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;S4 Capital’s prospectus confirmed it acquired Dutch content firm MediaMonks for $348 million (€300m or £266m) in July. MediaMonks operates through 11 offices in 10 countries spanning the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. The combined group, with over 750 people, has clients including adidas, Amazon, GE, Google, Hyundai, JAB, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Netflix, 3G and Weber. MediaMonks services include digital experiences, product, content and ecommerce. The merger represents the first deal by S4Capital to create a new era, new media solution embracing data, content and technology. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a statement released by Sir Martin Sorrell, Executive Chairman of S4 Capital, on the future renaming of Derriston Capital plc to S4 Capital plc, and the publication of the prospectus ahead of relisting, it stated -&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yesterday's publication of the prospectus ahead of relisting marks an important third step in three months for S4 Capital, having recently agreed the acquisition of Derriston and its merger with MediaMonks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;S4 Capital intends to provide global, multi-national, regional, local clients and influencer-driven millennial brands with new age/new era digital marketing services concentrated in three key areas initially - further development of a global digital content platform; first-party data fuelling both digital media planning and creative ideas too; and, finally, digital media buying. Listening to clients of all kinds, it seems apparent they want these services delivered faster, better and cheaper, by more agile and responsive organisations, either co-located with them or alone. To this end, S4 Capital will be organised primarily on a unitary basis, with key people continuing to be incentivised through significant, equity ownership in the enterprise as a whole. S4 Capital believes that this strategy and structure will deliver significant long-term value for share owners, particularly through organic growth, supported by strategically-focused acquisitions.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;S4 Capital through MediaMonks already currently works with some of the world’s most prestigious brands, such as adidas, Corona, Google, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson, Netflix and Shell through eleven offices in ten countries in the United States, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia Pacific. We are now looking to expand the digital content platform into new high potential growth territories, such as Germany, India and Japan and broaden and deepen the platform itself. We are also exploring new areas of operation in line with our strategic objectives, in data analytics and digital media planning and buying.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The $1 trillion advertising and marketing services industry is changing rapidly. Clients have had to deal with modest GDP growth, little inflation and hence limited pricing power and pressure to reduce costs for the last ten years, since the Lehman crisis. At the same time, digital transformation has disrupted innovation, manufacturing, distribution and marketing. The communications services industry, itself, has faced potential disruption from new media companies, predominantly Google, Facebook, Amazon, Alibaba and TenCent, from the consulting companies, from in-housing and from start-up millennial driven brands. Whilst this is a very challenging environment in many respects, the industry’s scale and continued growth, particularly in the digital, media and data areas offer tremendous opportunity to well-funded, agile and entrepreneurial disrupters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Welcome back to the future.&lt;/em&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>BW Marketing Whitebook Launch: Technology plays a big role in marketing: Experts </news:title>
      <news:description>Is marketing keeping pace with technology, what are the trends that marketers should stay on top of to stay relevant in the age of Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR) and the likes, industry experts tried to analyse this and many other pain points during a panel discussion at BW Businessworld’s Marketing Whitebook Launch on Wednesday in Bengaluru.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The panel included MA Parthasarathy, President, Product &amp;amp; FAST- South Asia, Mindshare; Parag Amalnerkar, Director Marketing- India &amp;amp; South Pacific, Net App; Satish Vishwanathan, Chief Product Officer, NxtGen Datacenter &amp;amp; Cloud Technologies; Srihari Palangala, Sr Director and Head of Marketing, Dell EMC; and Vasuta Agarwal, VP &amp;amp; GM, India &amp;amp; South Asia, InMobi. The panel discussion was moderated by Srinivas Uppaluri, Author, Advisor, Mentor, and Leadership Coach. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uppaluri in his opening remarks said that consumers only engage with those brands which align with their purpose, understand their context and allow control over engagement. He also added that technology plays a huge role in building and making marketing truly one to one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Uppaluri another major thing which technology has changed for marketers is the way the customer is engaged with and customer experience. “How do we choose what is the right technology and how do we prioritise between each options of technology available?” he asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vasuta spoke about the cases which makes Artificial Intelligence Modelling Language (AIML) very exciting. “The second technology that is revolutionizing the marketing sector is voice technology. AIML usage in the context of marketing, it helps in detecting, preventing, and controlling fraud and second is in the usage of creatives. Marketing is ultimately about storytelling and there are lot of emotions involved while coming to creatives. AIML can play role in the creative side, they can help in optimising things which cannot be detected by human eye."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She continued, “To highlight on the Voice technology side, we can take Alexa and Chatbox as examples. Voice tech plus marketing can revolutionize marketing in a country like India where next set of customers can come from Tier 2 cities and rural areas.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parag spoke about two trends namely Augmented Reality and Virtual reality. He said, “Let me give an example of used cases. One of the biggest problems with Myntra as a brand was while the customers buy shoes online, the size doesn’t fit, and due to this reason return of purchased products were very high. They used technologies where a consumer can take the photograph of his or her feet, there was a virtual ruler using you can measure your size and place the order and the returns and exchanges went down drastically after this. I think it is a classic example how technology is helping to solve a problem.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When asked to identify the biggest technology in terms of Marketing Srihari said, “Technology is playing a big role in marketing and there is a plethora of options available and it is very difficult to pick one among them. So, the points I concentrate on are - does the technology help in targeting customers, personalisation, ability to figure out ROI and fourth my ability to respond to it in the market very quickly.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Satish spoke about biggest challenge technology poses for his organisation. “The first challenge is the number of options available for us. Technology is the new enabler, and should we adopt tech to solve a marketing problem? We go with a technology only if that is inevitable, we don’t use technology in our business just because it is available. Value delivered from technology is one of the key criteria to use it,” he said.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Parthasarathy added, “Despite all this marketing hasn’t changed, it is still segmenting, targeting, and positioning. It is still trying to identify where your growth, who are the people who is going to provide you with the growth. Technology and data have transformed our knowledge of consumers.”</news:description>

      <news:title>Tata Sky issues public notice for discontinuing channels, TV18 follows suit&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>Tata Sky published a public notice period in an English daily on September 9 saying that&amp;nbsp;the DTH platform will cease close to 100 channels in 15 days time due to the failure of mutual understanding to renew the agreement between the parties. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As per the notice, from September 24, the DTH operator will stop airing channels such as&amp;nbsp;Cineplex HD, CNBC Bajar, CNBC TV18 Prime HD, CNN News18, Colors Bangla HD, Colors Infinity HD, Colors Kannada HD, Colors Marathi HD, Colors Odia, Colors Super, Comedy Central HD, ETV Abhiruchi, ETV Andhra Pradesh, ETV Cinema, ETV HD, ETV Life, ETV-Plus, ETV-Telangana, News18 Bihar/ Jharkhand, News18 Madhya Pradesh/ Chhattisgarh, News18 Bangla, News18 Gujarati, News18 Odia, New18 Uttar Pradesh/ Uttaranchal, News18 Urdu, News18 Rajasthan, News18 Kannada, News18 Punjab/ Haryana/ Himachal Pradesh, News18 India, News18 Kerala, News18 Tamil Nadu, News18 Lokmat, News18 Assam/ North East, Colors Tamil, Rishtey Cineplex, Rishtey, Nick Jr, Nick HD+, FYI TV19, History TV18, MTV, MTV Beats, MTV Beats HD, MTV HD+, VH1, VH1 HD, CNN International, HBO HD, WB, Colors HD, Comedy Central, History TV18 HD, Cartoon Network, HBO, Pogo, Sonic and News18 to name a few.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536892653_SBDgOX_tataorder.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later, Indiacast Media Distribution, the&amp;nbsp;distribution arm of TV18, issued a public notice saying its&amp;nbsp;channels are likely to be disconnected after three weeks&amp;nbsp;on ground of non-signing of agreement and that subscribers catered by operators across India are likely to be affected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536892621_ZGPsE1_tv18order.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the TDSAT order, the petitioner is claiming a right to treat the agreement whose term has expired on 31 July, 2018 to be operative for a further period of three months as a matter of right. On the other hand, the stand of the respondents is that only when the negotiations are still continuing meaningfully in the opinion of both the parties, the agreement can hold the field for a further period of three months at the maximum. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hence, the respondents claim a right to issue the impugned notice asking the petitioner to enter into a RIO based agreement on account of failure of negotiations. Of course, the petitioners’ stand is that the negotiations are and can still to go on,&amp;nbsp;but it is disputed by the respondents.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The order further stated, “This Tribunal has been consistently of the view that the parties should be given an opportunity to go for final negotiations for a limited period and if the efforts for negotiated agreement fail, then there is no option but to execute a RIO based agreement. In the present case also we are inclined to follow the same view. Hence, without prejudice to the case of the parties, we direct the parties to enter into a fresh round of negotiations for a period 30 days from today. In case parties are able to arrive at a negotiated agreement, it goes without saying that they can enter into an interconnect agreement on that basis. Otherwise, on expiry of the said period 30 days, if the petitioner is inclined to avail TV signals offered by the respondents, they must enter into a RIO based agreement in accordance with the Regulations.”</news:description>

      <news:title>We need to eliminate stereotyping in our ads: D Shivakumar, Chairman, ASCI</news:title>
      <news:description>At the recent board meeting of The Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), D Shivakumar, Group Executive President, Corporate Strategy, Aditya Birla Group, was unanimously elected as the Chairman of the Board of ASCI. As a member of the Board of Governors for past three years, he has always supported self-regulation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shivakumar has spent over 19 years in sales, marketing and general management positions across consumer products and the luxury industry. He succeeds Abanti Sankaranarayanan, Chief Strategy and Corporate Affairs officer, Diageo India. exchange4media chatted with the newly elected Chairman on how he plans to chart a new course for the self-regulatory body, government’s intervention in regulating advertising and more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edited excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your visions for ASCI for the next one year? How do you plan to chart a new course for the body?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;ASCI has been around since 1985. Advertising remains imperative in today's world. The total advertising expenditure is over Rs 70,000 crore. ASCI is a self-regulatory body. So my visions are to increase the awareness around ASCI among consumers. ASCI has excellent collaboration with Doordarshan and Department of Consumer Affairs, etc. We would be working towards getting more industry participation and towards working closely with the government, regulator and ecosystem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel ASCI needs more power to actually take action against offenders? Critics say that the damage is already done by the time ASCI reacts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As more sectors and people join the ASCI movement, I think we will see better compliance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of the key suggestions that have come forward on improving ASCI?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is nothing like one key suggestion. It is evolving as and when new things come up and that will keep happening. Whether you’ve had to do with automotives or herbal medicines or insurance, as and when something comes up, people do talk about it. An area which will become significantly important is celebrity advertising.  Around 50 per cent of all advertising today is celebrity advertising. There are a lot of challenges in this space from society. Brands need to worry that&amp;nbsp;the celebrity is the right person.&amp;nbsp;Also, there is&amp;nbsp;the liability factor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With regards to holding celebrities accountable for the products they endorse, shouldn’t brands be accountable for exploiting consumers’ insecurities?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall, today trust is a premium in the world. I think any type of stereotyping in advertising or communication won’t go well. We need to think about and eliminate stereotyping or any kind of edginess. Today, we have to be far more mindful about advertising and far more sensitive to the society. A number of brands might not be recognising it today, but they need to adhere to this. So it’s important for brands to be mindful of society’s boundaries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If there is one thing that the advertising needs to address right now, what would you advise?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advertising industry is such a large one. The heart of all advertising is creativity. I feel that digital now gives advertising far more latitude and power than ever before. The Supreme Court recently abolished Section 377. Over 20 brands took advantage of it, releasing topical ads and creatives riding the wave. Creativity and responsiveness to fast-changing events remain the biggest challenge for advertising today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the months gone by, is there a particular sector that you have seen attracting a larger number of complaints compared to the others? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The magic remedies and special interest groups do attract a large number of complaints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your opinion on government’s intervention when it comes to the regulation of advertising? Can ASCI work in tandem with a government body?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes. All self-regulation has to be of influence and negotiation. We have to work in tandem with not just the government and the regulator, but also with advertising agencies, advertisers, media-houses, etc.</news:description>

      <news:title>The new Nike film 'Rallying Cry' celebrates the power of female determination</news:title>
      <news:description>Women are at the top of their game and are making the world listen every day, in sport and in life. Rallying Cry, a new film from Nike, is a celebration of strong, independent women experiencing the frustration, exhilaration and pure emotion that only sport can bring. It captures the visceral, vocal joy of sport – serving as a rallying cry to inspire other women to express their power and move the world forward through sport. It’s a call to action to Make The World Listen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536756007_pDXLTE_FA18_JDI_APLA_GYM_AMBER_1027_rgb.jpg" style="width:443px;height:295px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The film features athletes from across Asia Pacific and Latin America such as Amber Liu, South Korean singer and dancer; Aori Nishimura, Japanese skateboarder; Valeria Piazza, Peruvian advocate for women’s empowerment; Rachwin Wong, Thai actress and avid runner; and Sam Kerr Australian football star.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536756038_CJeLMn_image005_%282%29.jpg" style="width:443px;height:249px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As part of a broader Just Do It campaign, the Rallying Cry film will run in Asia Pacific and Latin American countries starting 12 September.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A rally cry is more than a yell. It’s a visceral response to a mental reaction — frustration, elation and every emotion in between. It’s a call to assemble. It’s a call to advance. In sports, the rally cry can turn the tide of a game, and in the process, change the trajectory of a life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536756048_ZRGwSC_NIKE-JDI-RALLYING-CRY-%288%29.jpg" style="width:443px;height:286px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new Just Do It film, “Rallying Cry,” testifies to the power of female determination, and shows how today’s women break down barriers through sport. The film features athletes from across the world, including Australian boxer Tayla Harris, Thai runner Rachwin Wong, Australian footballer Sam Kerr, Japanese skateboarder Aori Nishimura, South Korean dancer Amber Liu, and more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

ASCI’s momentous achievements for the year include successful completion of three year-long collaboration with Department of Consumer Affairs, renewal of Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Food Safety Standards Authority of India, introduction of “Guidelines for Celebrities in Advertising” and inclusion in AYUSH’s Empowered Committee to control misleading ads of AYUSH drugs.

ASCI has been built on the foundation of self-regulation and the wisdom of the previous chairmen and the board. It is my privilege to do the role now”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) established by ASCI is an independent body (majority of its members drawn from civil society members like consumer activists, lawyers, doctors, educationists), the CCC met 47 times during the year and deliberated on complaints against 2641 advertisements. Complaints against 1177 advertisements were upheld, while for 483 they were not upheld. The significant increase in the number of complaints as compared to 2016-17 numbers (2300) is largely due to ASCI’s Suo Moto Monitoring project viz. National Advertisement Monitoring Services (NAMS). The Independent Review Process (IRP) received a very favourable response and 30 IRPs were conducted during this year.</news:description>

      <news:title>Our mantra is to innovate with purpose: Prashant Gaur, Chief Brand Officer, Pizza Hut&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>Pizza Hut, over the last 20 years of its existence in India,&amp;nbsp;has become&amp;nbsp;a renowned brand in the QSR domain. Constant innovation, on-point marketing game and customising to suit the Indian palate are few areas that have ensured its strong presence in the country. Even the brand's advertising strategy emphasises on it&amp;nbsp;being an ‘International brand with an Indian Heart’.&lt;br&gt;Prashant Gaur, Chief Brand Officer, Pizza Hut, looks&amp;nbsp;to deliver the core proposition of the brand in the most engaging and entertaining ways while simultaneously&amp;nbsp;believing that&amp;nbsp;the core strategy of any brand remains the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We chatted with him about&amp;nbsp;the brand’s new&amp;nbsp;marketing exercise, how important is a celebrity association for the brand, and more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brand Pizza Hut has engaged with a celebrity (Abhay Deol) after a hiatus of eight&amp;nbsp;years. Why such a long gap&amp;nbsp;and was it important to associate a celebrity with&amp;nbsp;the brand after all these years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having a celebrity (Abhay Deol) to endorse the campaign was not the main objective. Earlier too, we have collaborated with celebrities. &lt;br&gt;This campaign was about getting the right characters basis the demands and requirements of the script. We needed someone who&amp;nbsp;stood out as cool, confident and self-assured of the choices he/she makes. Looking at all these attributes, we felt we should have someone like Abhay Deol&amp;nbsp;who has his own charisma and style, to be the face of the campaign. The beauty about him is that he has&amp;nbsp;both, niche as well as&amp;nbsp;mass appeal. So we felt that Abhay would be the right person to pull this one off. And since he is a celebrity, there is also a collateral benefit that you get in order&amp;nbsp;to reach out to the masses. Having a celebrity face&amp;nbsp;also depends from brand to brand. Pizza Hut is considered the most trusted food service brand amongst its consumers for 12 years in a row. On that front, I don’t think we need any more endorsement. I think our best endorsers are our consumers who have been telling us “we love you” and “we trust you”. Usually, if there is a new entrant in the category or anything outside that the brand wants&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;immediately&amp;nbsp;cut through or reach, then definitely&amp;nbsp;celebrity endorsements make a lot of sense.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see the next phase of brand Pizza Hut in India as there is immense competition in the QSR domain? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Competition is prevalent for every brand, whether inside or outside the category. As far as Pizza Hut is concerned, we have been here for more than 20 years now. If we look back at&amp;nbsp;the past 3-4 years, we have witnessed an&amp;nbsp;explosive growth trajectory, which is what we will continue to strive for in the future. &lt;br&gt;During this next exciting phase of the brand, our plans are even more aggressive, so that&amp;nbsp;we can achieve greater growth. You can expect lots of exciting developments from Pizza Hut this year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Consumers still seek bigger brands that have a&amp;nbsp;national presence&amp;nbsp;and provide best-in-class experience. As a brand, our competition is not just at a&amp;nbsp;national level;&amp;nbsp;we even have competition&amp;nbsp;in the international space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The brand aims for 700 stores by 2025, what is the marketing strategy and plans to complete this&amp;nbsp;vision? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The milestone of 700 stores is a business strategy and I would not like to comment on that. From a marketing perspective, we want to be consistent. I think being consistent for a long period of time&amp;nbsp;is a tough thing for any brand. At Pizza Hut, we are consistently giving our consumers the best product and our endeavor is to also give them a consistent best-in-class experience across all our restaurants. This is our main strategy for the brand in a nut shell. If we stick to this, I am sure we will hit all the milestones for our growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of marketing strategies work best&amp;nbsp;for the brand? Influential, experimental or any other type of marketing tools that Pizza Hut is using this year? &lt;/strong&gt;                   &lt;br&gt;I would like to highlight that the core strategy of any brand doesn’t change. What you stand for today is what you will stand for tomorrow. However, you evolve with time and so does the category of consumers as they are exposed to different cuisines. The role of technology has also changed in the QSR category. In fact, a large part of the QSR category&amp;nbsp;works like an e-commerce company&amp;nbsp;today. So, a brand must adapt and evolve proactively to remain relevant, fulfilling the needs of the company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India is a diverse market, especially from a&amp;nbsp;product offering point of view. How essential is it for a brand to innovate and expand&amp;nbsp;products?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are in a diverse market and the mantra that Pizza Hut as a brand uses is ‘innovate with purpose’. So, it must be meaningful for our consumers and we don’t do innovation just for the sake of it. It has to resonate with the brand and be meaningful for our consumers. We continuously take feedback from the consumers to keep in touch with the trends. We keep all of that in the equation to give our consumers what they want, thus innovation is of major importance to us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should brands re-launch brand strategy as part of&amp;nbsp;growth plans? What are your views?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a marketer I would say&amp;nbsp;a brand should always avoid a situation where you come to a point that your marketing strategy needs to be completely changed. Ideally, this should never happen, because you have to constantly and consistently evolve. It’s not a binary thing that you were something at a point of time and then&amp;nbsp;just changed&amp;nbsp;overnight. Even if you do so, the consumers will not accept it easily as they perceive that brand in a certain way. It is a very rigorous, hardworking and ever-changing process. The core of brand&amp;nbsp;Pizza Hut has never&amp;nbsp;changed. The expression will change overtime, which is purely on the basis of evolution in consumer behaviour and the category. But the core of the brand always remains the same. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brands these days are&amp;nbsp;using the&amp;nbsp;digital medium very heavily. What&amp;nbsp;about Pizza Hut?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are doing a lot of innovative things on our social media and search platforms to reach out to&amp;nbsp;loyal consumers. Specific to search, I must say that we have dramatically dialled-up our presence in the online space. Our business is a trade zone business. While our brand is present nationally, and soon we will have 400 stores, we have to target consumers who are in that trade zone, for which&amp;nbsp;we are leveraging the power of digital. With digital technology, we can target consumers in a hyper local manner. So, on platforms such as&amp;nbsp;Facebook and Google where consumers can discover the brand, we ensure that the consumers who are in the radius of a Pizza Hut store are aware about the brand.</news:description>

      <news:title>Brands brighten up Ganesh Chaturthi festivities with different campaign offerings</news:title>
      <news:description>Every year around August or September, the country is shaken up by a storm of activities during the ten-day festival of Ganesh Chaturthi. It thus comes as no surprise that brands join the festive fervour with campaigns which sublimely express the devotion of people towards Lord Ganesha. This year was no different in terms of brands cashing in on the buzz. We take a look at the campaigns that blended creativity and devotion this Ganesh Chaturthi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brooke Bond Red Label&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The emotional spot conceptualised by Geometry Encompass&amp;nbsp;shows a man going to buy an idol of Lord Ganesh as he is going to celebrate the festival for the first time. He enters a shop of Ganesha idols and the shop owner shows him some idols which he may like. The owner also offers him tea and asks his help to bring it. As the shop owner wears his traditional Muslim cap for his namaaz, the customer changes his mind of buying the idol from his shop. Making an excuse to leave the shop, he tells the owner that he has to go as he has some important work to do, and will return tomorrow. As he is leaving the shop, the owner asks him to at least drink the tea before leaving. Over the tea conversation, the ad gives a clear idea of the secular aspect of Ganesh Charurthi festival and threads together how people from different communities and religions celebrate this festival.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

Under its campaign “Bye Bye Ordinary, Hello HD”, new customers can opt for High-Definition connections that includes set-up box and antenna along with Gold Club HD pack, which offers 240+ channels and services including 30+ HD channels across Hindi entertainment /Sports/Kids and Infotainment, starting at just Rs 2703 for 3 months and Rs 4483 for 12 months plus taxes. It is going out of the way to maximise content through its ”Sampoorna Marathi” initiative, providing relevant Marathi channels in its bouquet. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philips &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Philips Lighting has launched Philips Hue illuminated ’Ganpati-on-Wheels’ mobile vans in the state. These vans are specially illuminated with Philips Hue and will travel across Maharashtra covering more than 30 cities between 3rd and 17th September 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536808259_CwIhiV_GanpatiOnWheels-01.jpg" style="width:443px;height:290px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brand has created the ‘Ganpati-on-Wheels’ to reach consumers’ homes directly with the mobile van.The ‘Ganpati-on-Wheels’ vans feature a beautiful and radiant white Ganpati idol displaying fascinating colorful lighting effects, enabled by connected and color changing Philips Hue LED lights, to brighten up the festivities. The vehicles will also offer prayers to the idol with ‘Ganesha aarti’ at all times and distribute ‘prasad’ to the visitors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snapdeal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brand is offering a choice of terracotta Ganesha idols, which are made entirely of clay and have no paint-based embellishments. These idols dissolve in water without leaving any harmful residue.The commonly used idols are made of Plaster of Paris (PoP) and are decorated with paints having high lead and mercury content. PoP chokes water bodies, while the toxic colors make the water acidic, disturbing the plants and marine life ecosystem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G S Tea&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The spot beautifully portrays the joy and fervour that Ganesh Chaturthi brings while threading in the brand’s tea offering. It shows a man tirelessly working on a Ganesh statue. After a point, he starts feeling fatigued only to be offered a cup of tea by a child who comes in the form of Ganesha to lift his spirits&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Watch: Traditional content marketing as effective as it was before: MD, Zirca Digital Solutions</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Initiative by Bloomberg Quint &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The digital landscape is always changing. And this has a profound impact on content marketing. What worked last year or even last month, may not work today and that makes it even more important for content marketers to be optimizing their strategies and prepping up for the major changes that are likely to come their way. Karan Gupta, Managing Director, Zirca Digital Solutions&amp;nbsp;shared with exchange4media his thoughts on the detailed content-marketing strategy required for the success of most organizations, if traditional content marketing is being left out in the digital push and more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited excerpts&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are your thoughts on the detailed content-marketing strategy required for the success of most organizations?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A detailed content-marketing strategy is really essential now more than ever. If you are going in for a content-marketing strategy, it is about something which is very detailed. When you are looking at the various aspects of your entire branded content story, you have to have the content-marketing story very well-embedded into it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content marketing can help reduce your overall marketing costs. Do you agree?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For now, I don’t agree that it will reduce the overall marketing cost because people aren’t just using content-marketing in a silo, they are using various forms of digital marketing and have begun to understand the importance of content-marketing as a whole. So in the short run, it might increase your budgets but in long run what happens is that with content-marketing, you tend to build a very strong bond with your consumer, something that lasts for more than a few seconds than what a regular ad would garner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So once you establish that connection with your consumer, you won’t have to spend much to get the consumer back to use your products or to understand what you’re trying to explain to them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about the transition of branded content from what it was five years ago to now?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look at digital, for example. The way content is being consumed now versus five years ago, the way we use OTT platforms now, the rate at which people are consuming data because of the data cost are making content-consumption easy and a required day-to-day activity. Content-marketing has become an almost no-brainer in today’s world where people are consuming large amounts of content and is an essential part of people’s lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think that traditional content marketing is being left out in the digital push?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;No, it isn’t being left-out. It is just that digital content-marketing is being brought in the limelight because digital consumers are consuming everyday but traditional content marketing is just as effective as it was ten years ago. It’s just that because of the limelight that digital marketing is getting, it just seems that the older formats are not given the importance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ixm6iPy8TTo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Atul Chand, Arshad Siddique and Suman Varma launch ExpertBridge</news:title>
      <news:description>Atul Chand, ex CEO, ITC Lifestyle, Arshad Siddiqui, ex CEO, Rasna and Suman Varma, ex head of operations North, Rediffusion Y&amp;amp;R, have come together to start their own company called ‘ExpertBridge’. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a boutique offering of experts-on-demand to the organisations in the areas of marketing brands, digital, trade marketing, sales &amp;amp; distribution and retail PR. It delivers a business led approach with comprehensive solutions ranging from strategy &amp;amp; consulting to talent &amp;amp; training. It is based on a new way of working called ‘The Gig Economy- comprising short-term assignments, consulting work and freelance assignments’. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elaborating further, Atul Chand says, “Experts bring on-board domain expertise, quality skills and strong networks that benefit businesses. Having ‘been there and done that’, they are in a position to leverage the business lessons and solve specific problems. The diversity of projects, flexibility of work, the opportunity to build a personal brand provide the experts-on-demand a sense of self-fulfilment.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Explaining the thought further, Arshad Siddiqui says, “We share a singular goal to empower organisations and drive lasting positive change through a leadership stance, by embracing a new way of working with Gig workforce or experts-on-demand. We work towards adding value to our client’s business.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Suman Varma, who has a strong agency background having worked for JWT for 22 years, and also as the head of operations North, Rediffusion Y&amp;amp;R says ExpertBridge already has a host of clients in the FMCG sector, in the food, beverage and lifestyle space. She adds, “The start-ups, small &amp;amp; mid- sized companies who are hungry for growth, and cannot afford high cost talent benefit a lot from ExpertBridge. Of late, we have ourselves become Gigers, taking on projects and leading from the front. These are exciting times for both- the individuals, who want to be independent and explore on one hand, and for companies who do not attract high quality talent on their payroll to get into short-term contractual arrangement.”</news:description>

      <news:title>We are friends, not foes in the content partnership paradigm: Kay Madati, Twitter</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is strengthening its content offering globally and in India as a testament to its commitment to delivering Live Content. Only, Twitter’s content strategy is different from that of other social media and OTT platforms which are also dabbling in Live Content. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kay Madati, Global VP of Content Partnerships, Twitter, told exchange4media that Twitter is seeing a lot of strength in its content business primarily because “We are not competing against anyone for rights or for rights to distribute content.” He says taking this approach has helped Twitter position its offering in a unique way in the marketplace. Twitter is positioning itself as an extension of audience reach strategies and their monetisation and business opportunities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Unique Strategy &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;Facebook is vying with media companies and OTT players like Amazon Prime Video for rights to distribute sports content. Facebook recently won the rights to exclusive show every La Liga game, for the next three seasons, to viewers in India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, The Maldives, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The social media network also hold the rights to distribute Major League Baseball to US audiences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Most of our partners see that more&amp;nbsp;complementary to their content execution plans than competitive. It is part of the reason we have received so much strength especially from the media companies and the rights holders that we work with,” Madati said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Prior to Twitter, Madati was at Viacom where he liaised here he sat on the other side of the table, trying to crack content deals. “It was very clear that some of the players are going to be competitors whereas Twitter is not a competitor,” he said speaking about his view of social media platforms from his time at Viacom. Now that he is part of the team at Twitter he said, “We are friends, not a foe in the content partnership paradigm. Our approach is distinctly different from how Facebook is approaching it in the marketplace.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He further added that the model that Twitter is following is “healthy for the ecosystem” and “is an interesting way for a linear television broadcaster to expand” their reach and audiences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Works on Twitter&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;“When something happens in the world, it happens on Twitter,” said Madati. And it is this basic insight on which Twitter is basing its Live Content strategy. “Video can be a way for people to understand what is happening and that live video content can bring that conversation to life on the platform,” Madati explained. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Twitter’s proposal to content owners is simple: “Conversation is happening on Twitter around content. Marrying that video content with the conversation on twitter that presents you with an opportunity to extend your audience reach and monetise that content as well.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Users on Twitter are not known to consume long form content on the platform, and Madati is completely cognizant of that behaviour. Which is why Twitter is looking for short-form content for the platform. “Fundamentally, we are looking for content in the moment. A goal is scored in a football match or a political development takes place, most of that conversation is taking place on Twitter and so we are looking for content that can tell stories and develop and create content in the cultural zeitgeist in the moment,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He added that Twitter’s efforts around content are true to the vision of the company which is to keep the world informed and serve the public conversation. “The content on the platform is structured to align with how we see people consuming content on the platform - which is generally shorter form content - content can quickly deliver the story narrative or the information that people on the internet can easily share and be distributed across the platform,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;India Partnerships&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;On Tuesday Twitter announced more than 50 premium video content collaborations in Asia Pacific region. Of these 12 are Indian partners who are collaborating for Live and Premium Video Content. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Live Video Content in the areas of News, Entertainment and Sports has many takers on Twitter, Madati said. He pointed out that video consumption in india is growing exponentially. “That is bringing a younger and more coveted audience and we are able to create and execute deals with key partners to access and leverage that receptive and influential set of audience. We are having a great amount of success with this kind of strategy,” he said.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madati said that since the growth of data infrastructure in India has accelerated over the last two years, the infrastructure is providing an opportunity to platforms and brands to reach more audiences. He added that Live Streams on Twitter in India have been smooth so far. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the entertainment space alone, Twitter is partnering with Comic Con India, ScoopWhoop, Filmfare, and Vh1 Supersonic for Live Video content in India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Red Chillies Entertainment, Vh1 Supersonic, Comic Con India, Network 18, Scoopwhoop, NDTV, Filmfare and CricBuzz, that Twitter will collaborate with to bring new content to audiences in the country and opportunities for Indian advertisers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the sports genre Cricbuzz has tied up with Twitter to bring Live episodes and clips of their flagship show Cricbuzz LIVE to Twitter. The shows and clips will cover the Asia Cup, India’s home series against the West Indies and India’s tour to Australia. News publishers The Quint and CNBC TV18 will broadcast live content on the automobile sector and the Union Budget coverage respectively.</news:description>

      <news:title>Watch: Content marketing cuts overall marketing cost: MD, Perfetti Van Melle India</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Initiative by Bloomberg Quint &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a fact well known that getting the word out about your brand through content marketing remains one of the most valuable ways to spend your time and marketing dollars. After all, content marketing makes your brand more searchable and increases its trust value. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Rajesh Ramakrishnan, MD, Perfetti Van Melle India, content marketing is becoming an integral part of the overall mix of brands. Ramakrishnan spoke to exchange4media about the key aspects of a good content marketing strategy and how it is of essence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited excerpts: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are your thoughts on the detailed content marketing strategy required for the success of most organisations?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;While traditional media still continues to play a big role, there is far more engagement coming from consumers-- the way they consume media, the way they expect things from brands in the media. As a consequence, content marketing is becoming more and more important. And I think it will continue to grow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What according to you are the key aspects of a good content marketing strategy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ultimately, I think, content marketing is about the meaningful role a brand can play in the life of the consumers and how it can really make their life better. And it’s not just what a brand can do for them from a pure product or service point of view. Therefore, if brands can get consumers to be more educated, can entertain them and engage with them, get them to think about past notions and how they can be re-evaluated, they can actually add value to the consumers' life and therefore serve the purpose from a content marketing point of view.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content marketing can help reduce your overall marketing costs. Do you agree?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think it can. There is a certain amount of money that you spend on media. And as you go along, more and more integrated plans come up, which include traditional media like television, print, and vernacular &amp;amp; localized content. You will have to manage with the amount of money that you have. But (with content marketing), you can gain more long-term engagement with consumers, which can ultimately lead to a saving in cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dLVvXdK2n6w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Oath Ad Platforms combines best ad tech services for advertisers: Rico Chan, MD, Oath </news:title>
      <news:description>Oath has completed a year. Here are excerpts from an email interaction with Rico Chan, Managing Director, Hong Kong, India and SEA, Oath, about how the new ad platform with advanced features will help drive growth for advertisers and publishers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It’s been a year since Oath was launched, but many users/advertisers still don’t know about the brand? How has the year been? Tell us about the progress.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’re proud of what we have achieved--bringing together AOL and Yahoo – two powerhouse media and technology brands. We unified our people, processes and products. Today, we reach one billion people around the world, with a dynamic mix of media and technology brands in our portfolio, including HuffPost, Yahoo Cricket, Tumblr, Yahoo Finance and Flurry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In India, we continued to build on the momentum, releasing a new Yahoo Mail mobile web experience, besides an Android Go app. We won plenty of user love for our refreshed Yahoo Cricket app. HuffPost India came into the Oath fold. With Aman Sethi on board as Editor-in-Chief, HuffPost is now bringing its compelling and trusted brand of storytelling to our audiences in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also engaged deeply with advertisers, publishers and consumers over the last year. We are now in the exciting phase of innovating our offerings. We want to build deep consumer experiences across our much-loved brands, launch new products and services on mobile and video and continue to grow our partnerships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the massive shift to mobile and Verizon (a Fortune 16 company and one of the largest mobile companies in the world)&amp;nbsp;as our parent company, we are just getting started on the opportunity ahead. We aim to put our brands on every mobile screen. Our goal is to reach 2 billion users by 2020. We see many of our new users coming from this part of the world, with India leapfrogging on mobile and home to over 450 million mobile Internet users – a number that continues to rise sharply. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see the digital advertising trend in India and where would you place Oath and its various brands within this canvas?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital advertising is gaining huge ground in India, and is expected to grow by 30 per cent&amp;nbsp;YoY in 2018. With increasing demand for cross-screen experiences and strong growth in mobile Internet usage, mobile marketing is a huge opportunity in India. This is a very exciting landscape. There’s been a phenomenal rise in online content consumption and we are well placed to offer the content consumers love and expect here, across our brands. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we combine the power of our content, scale and data, we see tremendous opportunities to help advertisers in India build stronger relationships with consumers. We recently introduced Oath Ad Platforms, which delivers a simplified suite of intelligent advertising and publishing solutions to drive growth for advertisers and publishers. New innovative ad experiences as part of the suite will help us deliver creative and impactful campaigns for brands in this market. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are simultaneously building meaningful consumer experiences on our brands that can take us closer to the Indian consumers. We want to be responsive to the needs of the Indian audience, many of whom will be coming online for the first time on their mobile phones. Yahoo Mail recently released an entirely new mobile web experience (alongside an Android Go app). We know that several users in India grapple with poor connectivity and data limitations. This new mobile web experience offers improved usability on top of a modern design. Irrespective of their hardware or connectivity issues, we wanted our users here to have a better, more enjoyable and productive Yahoo Mail experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are innovating to build immersive consumer experiences that deeply engage Indian consumers. In less than four months of its refresh, the Yahoo Cricket app touched 1.5 million downloads on Android, with users giving it a 4.49 star rating on Google Play. They were quickly hooked to the lightning fast scores, crisp match info and easy access to news listings. During this year’s IPL, we made the scores on the app available in 7 different regional languages--&amp;nbsp;Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Bengali and Malayalam-- to engage with our regional users. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Studies show mobile internet is predominantly used by young Indians and we are invested in engaging deeply with this audience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the brands you are working for in India?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have a gamut of advertisers across industries, from consumer goods to e-commerce, tourism and consumer technology, to name just a few. They include Amazon, Nike, Lufthansa Airlines, Lenovo, Airtel, Toyota and Asian Paints.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We work extensively with banking &amp;amp; financial services advertisers. Bajaj Allianz, HDFC Asset Management, ICICI Lombard, Kotak Mahindra being a few of our top advertisers. We recently signed an exclusive partnership with online marketplace BankBazaar, for a co-branded site accessible from the Yahoo Finance HomePage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Oath’s strategy to compete with competitors like Facebook and Google?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The digital marketing space is enormous and still growing. The spaces are differentiated. There is so much opportunity both on the consumer side and on the advertiser side. Our goal is to reach 2 billion users by 2020. If you look at how people are coming online, the vast majority are accessing the Internet for the first time on their mobile phones. This is a US $800 billion-$1 trillion industry, but mobile accounts for just a fraction of it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We see tremendous opportunity in the mobile consumer economy, which is growing rapidly, and nowhere more so than in India. Today’s mobile consumer is empowered. This one device is increasingly controlling the entire experience – how people search, shop, communicate, consume information, news and entertainment. We want to provide customers with must-have mobile content and services. We want to give other businesses or partners access to those consumers on mobile. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As we look through their lens, giving customers and advertisers what they want and need, we have some distinctive advantages at Oath. The combination of our trusted content, distribution, and data sets us apart from other players in the market.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Oath’s POV on ad fraud and prevention? What is the state of transparency in ad tech? What is Oath’s approach to providing transparency for its clients and partners, specifically in the world of programmatic?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As advertisers seek quality environments in which to run their ads, increased transparency in the programmatic ecosystem has become essential, now more than ever before.

company’s audience engagement and content monetization strategies,” said Kay Madati, Global VP of Content&#13;
Partnerships, Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

the younger millennial audience in Asia Pacific,” said Maya Hari, Vice President of Asia Pacific, Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

success of our premium video content launch at All That Matters last year, we&#13;
are proud to expand our live stream and video highlights programming that is&#13;
brand safe and will appeal to the audience and advertisers in APAC. The move&#13;
strengthens Twitter’s presence and partnerships in the region, sharing with the&#13;
world what’s happening right now in Asia Pacific and for global audiences to&#13;

The matter will be taken up in the&amp;nbsp;Supreme Court today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Earlier,&amp;nbsp;on 5 September, the court had deferred the matter to September 11. However, the Apex court adjourned the petition to September 12&amp;nbsp;as the matter could not come up for hearing post lunch on September 11.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On July 3, 2018, TRAI had implemented the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable) Interconnection (Addressable Systems) Regulations 2017 after it was upheld by the Madras High Court with an exception. While bringing the order into effect on July 3, the TRAI had prescribed timelines for the stakeholders.

      <news:title>Britannia and Interbrand partner to launch Britannia's new brand image</news:title>
      <news:description>After successfully partnering with Godrej, Jio and Infosys to bring in the cutting-edge global practices of strategic branding to India, Interbrand and Britannia celebrated the launch of the much-awaited Britannia positioning and identity this month. The occasion also marks the centenary year of Britannia, as also its orbit shifts into being a total foods company.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the second half of 2016, Britannia’s board of directors, after a rigorous process of evaluating multiple global and local branding firms, tasked Interbrand, with the responsibility to contemporise the brand. The brief was to rejuvenate the centenarian to lead the new consumers and market opportunities to reflect the company’s future plans and portfolio expansion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What followed thereafter was an elaborate 2 year long brand engagement involving the right analysts, strategists and design experts from across the Interbrand’s India, Madrid and London offices, who drew upon the wisdom of Britannia leadership, varied consumer cohorts, chefs and nutritionists. Insights drawn from these formed the basis of the refreshed new positioning for the brand – ‘Exciting Goodness’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brand’s new positioning of Exciting Goodness espouses the increasingly relevant idea of balance. The new logo celebrates this beautiful balance between the two fundamental choice drivers - Wellbeing and Excitement as also between accessibility and premium. Remarkably, Britannia is uniquely placed to champion this growing philosophy for consumption as well as lifestyle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536655013_iA1Wn7_Ashish-Mishra---MD%2C-Interbrand-India.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ashish Mishra, Managing Director, Interbrand India &lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on partnering with Britannia on this milestone, Ashish Mishra, Managing Director, Interbrand India, said, “When good and fun combine, new possibilities arise. The idea was to dispel the belief that what is good will not be fun and what is fun will never be good. Exciting Goodness not only provides a unique positioning for Britannia portfolio but also informs its purpose and its future innovations framework.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clarifying the need for the rebrand, Mishra added,&amp;nbsp;“Although the world around the legacy of the Britannia business including attitudes, drivers and competition had changed, mere design refresh was not the genesis for the rebrand. The compelling reason for the rebrand was judiciously strategic. It was to bring the future business strategy to life through the new brand. The future Britannia business ambition warranted a stronger connect with the youth and broad basing of the portfolio from biscuits while retaining its premium. That’s what precipitated one of the more challenging rebrands of the decade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Britannia also works as an exemplary demonstration of how the longstanding master brands need to be treated”, added Mishra. “The heritage mother brands in our market, as also in many other parts of the world typically undergo an existential challenge. They all begin with being primary brands for the original product/s and gain substantial equity over time. The same equity provides the strength for extensions and expansions into newer categories through new sub or product brands. Over time the product brands become big and get managed by dedicated teams at Business Unit levels. And begin to have more attention and investments into brand building. Interestingly, in spite of such scenarios persisting for many decades, the mother brands continue to play a decisive influence in the customer’s choice. This is an empirically proven fact that we have reaffirmed through our analysis and rebranding some of the most valuable Indian brands ranging from Godrej to Britannia, over the decade. The basic job that we thus wanted to deliver was to rejuvenate the mother brand Britannia. We did that by establishing the high role of Britannia vis-a-vis the product brands through analytics that apportioned the sub category choice drivers between the mother and product brands. This provided a strategic basis for portfolio management, brand architecture as well as innovations.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536655003_N8SVZs_Borja-Borrero---Executive-Creative-Director%2C-EMEA-and-LatAm.jpg" style="width:300px;height:300px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borja Borrero, Executive Creative Director, EMEA, LatAm and India &lt;/em&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharing the design thinking to suit the positioning, Borja Borrero, Executive Creative Director, EMEA, LatAm and India said: “Translating into a compelling language everything what Britannia will stand for in the future was quite a challenge. We needed to convey all the heritage of the brand while bringing new visual and verbal codes into the brand expression to communicate a sense of newness. The result is an identity that encapsulates the best of two worlds: excitement and wellbeing. It’s not so much about a logo evolution but rather a new storytelling that brings the new brand strategy to life. Britannia opens up and expands towards new horizons; this is the idea behind the new narrative that uses landscapes as a backdrop (wellbeing) while people interact and enjoys life in different ways (excitement). This is clear in all the new “key visuals” created for the new narrative. Besides this, a new colour palette, bespoke fonts, illustrations, pictograms, tone of voice, etc. was created”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Providing a deeper perspective behind the change, Manjunath Desai, Head -Consumer Insight, Media &amp;amp; Competitive Intelligence, Britannia Industries said,&lt;br&gt;“For around a century now, Britannia has transformed itself at strategically chosen junctures in anticipation of changes in the consumer/business ecosystem and to reflect its renewed aspirations. The year 2018 forms such a cusp, for Britannia, it marks the completion of its first century of delighting India and prepares for the next by setting an ambitious goal and taking fresh guard. This identity make-over symbolizes its preparedness for the journey to its next stop, ‘Total Foods Company’, in a milieu that will be entirely different from its first 100 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When one attempts refresh of a century old brand that is blessed with love and respect of more than a billion people, diligence and care become as essential an ingredient as creativity and foresight. Which is why we set the boundary of change to be ‘far enough to notice, near enough to recognize’. It is always a challenge to communicate complex messages through visual symbols, made more difficult by the strict definition of boundaries. But team Interbrand navigated the difficult path with aplomb. As is the norm, changed identity was extensively tested with consumers and all of us were delighted by the double thumbs-up they awarded it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elaborating further about the design challenges of rebranding a heritage brand, Borja added: “Indeed ‘far enough to notice and near enough to recognise’ was a mantra that we all finally began to chant. The stakeholders included the board, the leadership, the employees and the customers. And given the high value of the customer as well as the employee brand, the expectation of dramatic change battled the emotion of familiarity all along. A fair share of English-illiterate customers of the popular brand made recognition an added consideration. Reassurances from the global network of Interbrand and a comprehensive study of the rebranding paradigms of heritage brands around the world were employed to navigate the decision-making. The journey was challenging but enjoyable and the rigor was certainly befitting the stature of Britannia.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the occasion, Ali Harris, Head of Marketing, Britannia Industries said, “We have a 100 year heritage and wanted to be sure that we continued to reach every Indian household - to bring in a newness yet remain uniquely Britannia. We undertook extensive research to help us unlock how consumers viewed Britannia and found that consumers place our brand right in the middle of excitement and goodness. This helped inform our new brand proposition, designed within a framework that balances our heritage and provides a contemporary appeal to the brand. Designed under the premise that our products carry both excitement and goodness, we held on to our heritage red, made green a bit more vibrant and added in a new color yellow. The new logo identity also has great shelf throw, which is critical in our cluttered retail environment. As we look to emerge as a 'Global total foods company’, this new logo is crafted to unbox Britannia and open it up to bright new horizons”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adding to the excitement of rebranding country’s most valuable food brand was also another milestone for Interbrand India. “About a decade back we began our first partnership in India and rebranded Godrej. Since then, through the prestigious projects including JIO branding, Infosys repositioning and design, and Mahindra’s global brand roadmap; we believe we have been privileged to be the partners for the decades top 5 branding jobs. We feel delighted about world’s leading brand consultancy becoming India’s leading too” added Mr. Mishra wishing its partner Britannia, 100 more years of growth!</news:description>

      <news:title>Full service agency model only effective working way in future: Rana Barua</news:title>
      <news:description>From bringing in new clients and awards to growing the&amp;nbsp;agency business, ad-man&amp;nbsp;Rana Barua has worked as CEO&amp;nbsp;with the likes of Contract India, Creativeland Asia, Law &amp;amp; Kenneth, among others and helped them accelerate growth and creativity. Renowned&amp;nbsp;agencies such as Ogilvy &amp;amp; Mather, Rediffusion Y&amp;amp;R, McCann and Bates also feature in his work experience. He quit CLA as CEO in June.&amp;nbsp;In a free-wheeling chat with exchange4media, Barua speaks about the agency space, if there lies an actual value for award shows in advertising and more.&amp;nbsp;Edited excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;After CLA, what's on the cards? Would you&amp;nbsp;rather prefer joining an agency or starting something of your own? &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am in the midst of weighing multiple scenarios and should be able to firm up next plans, soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You’ve worked with diverse agencies right from HTA (JWT), Ogilvy, McCann, Y&amp;amp;R to Contract. Do you feel that standalone agencies are&amp;nbsp;better at fostering creativity?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having worked in both standalone and integrated environments, I do feel that standalone agencies have their limitations. While they enhance the creative product, the overall business potential is very restrictive, as one is working in a uni-dimensional funnel&amp;nbsp;in a world which is working in a dynamic and multi-dimensional way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Out of all your advertising stints, which has been&amp;nbsp;the most challenging one?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;It would be fair to say that the Contract stint was the most exciting. I say this because under my leadership, we restaged brand Contract in a very short time and iContract became a major digital force to reckon with. Collectively, Contract and all its divisions, punched way above its weight and expectations, resulting in many client wins, awards and accolades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The professional environment for advertising agencies has changed dramatically in recent decades- pressure from the market, pressure from clients to be efficient, new forms of advertising. If you compare the way you work today to the advertising business when you started off, what has changed? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;The world has changed and so have the Consumers along with their media consumption habits. It’s neither pressure nor is it new forms but simply put, the environment, mediums and our overall lives that have changed due to the advent of technology. We are in the&amp;nbsp;business of ideas, which will always remain the fundamental of our business, and that will never change.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Also how have client budgets at a craft level been?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clients are well aware and very objective in their approach. Advertising was and remains a very serious and significant portion of their marketing mix and budgets are thus a resultant of the mar-keting objective. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are your thoughts on the full-service agency model? Do you see it making a comeback?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt; I totally believe and advocate a full service agency model. It is a huge differentiator with all the necessary division expertise and can be a strength for any agency or ecosystem that can demonstrate effective working together of the same. &lt;br&gt;As per my belief, the full service agency model&amp;nbsp;is going to be the only effective working way, as we move ahead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Which was creatively the most gratifying ad campaign you have worked on in your career? Also which is your current favourite ad campaign?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Contract, the team had created a memorable campaign for TATA Docomo - Bhalai ke Supply. It was gratifying as it broke through clutter, won many accolades, awards and also created many fabulous conversations for the brand and for Contract.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Current campaign,&amp;nbsp;I really like the Swiggy work. They are short, smart and fabulously deliver&amp;nbsp;the essence and advantage of Swiggy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do you feel that there lies an actual value in award shows for advertising?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;Absolutely. We are in a business of creativity and awards is a way of recognising and applauding the idea, craft, thought. It is a must for our industry and any other which is similar (Music, Movies, etc).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, awards should be coveted and revered. We cannot have an award ceremony every other week!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Is talent retention an issue in the agency space?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the same as any other industry. With newer forms of professional gratification and mushrooming of new careers, it is bound to happen. The positive bit about our industry is, we will never have a dearth of talent as ours is a business of ideas, creative and myriad of challenges that will keep attracting smarter and brighter talent.</news:description>

      <news:title>LinkedIn introduces Dynamic Ads in Campaign Manager</news:title>
      <news:description>Professional networking platform LinkedIn has announced that LinkedIn Dynamic Ads are now available directly in Campaign Manager. The tool will make it easier for marketers to send personalised ads to every professional in their target audience across LinkedIn, whether they are running campaigns on their own via self-service, or working with LinkedIn account team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the company, Dynamic Ads help marketers build deeper relationships with audience by automatically customising ad creative with the publicly available information from LinkedIn member profiles.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;LinkedIn Marketing Solutions has now made all key formats available via self-service, making it easy for all online marketers — regardless of size — to leverage LinkedIn’s advertising tools. Dynamic Ads is the final native ad unit to become available on a self-service basis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advertisers, like Procore Technologies and Vistage, have used Dynamic Ads to tailor campaigns to feature their company, product, service, event and more. As a result, LinkedIn Dynamic Ads have shown up to 2X the click-through rate of traditional display ads, the company said in a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With LinkedIn Dynamic Ads, marketers can:&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get closer with audience&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The native format delivers a new level of personalization. Because the creative is automatically personalised with each member’s profile info, such as their photo, first name, company and job title, one can capture audience’s attention in a way that standard display ads can’t.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personalise creative at scale&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Personalisation has been made simpler. Marketers can build creative and write ad copy once, and LinkedIn takes care of the rest by automatically personalizing the campaign for each person to be targeted. One can add macros — data mapping tools — for even greater customization capabilities. Dynamic Ads also include pre-built templates to streamline creative, and auto-translation to engage prospects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Achieve full funnel marketing objectives&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Dynamic Ads work for every stage of the buyer’s journey with different formats. To drive brand awareness, “follower ads” promote the company or showcase page to help build a community. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, marketers can now see how their campaigns are performing and leverage A/B testing to optimise your Dynamic Ads campaigns directly in Campaign Manager.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dynamic Ads will be available in Campaign Manager for all businesses within the next week.</news:description>

      <news:title>India Today TV launches 'Political Stock Exchange' ahead of 2019 General Elections </news:title>
      <news:description>With the 2019 general elections looming, India Today TV has launched Political Stock Exchange, a one of a kind show hosted by Rajdeep Sardesai and Rahul Kanwal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The show is a next generation innovation that will revolutionise election analysis. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Political Stock Exchange will air every week, with Rajdeep and Rahul cracking the political divide, tracking the political worth of each party and evaluating their leadership. The show is a report card of whose stock is soaring and whose graph is slipping and what are the issue of concern to the Indian voter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The landmark show is designed to gauge political sentiments and present the real story to the viewers in a "matter of fact fashion". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leading up to the face-off between PM Narendra Modi and the opposition, Political Stock Exchange showcases actual data from the battleground by AXIS MY INDIA, the most credible number crunching pollster. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their PSE survey&lt;a href="https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/political-stock-exchange-raje-rajasthan-chouhan-axis-my-india-1334767-2018-09-07" rel="nofollow"&gt; https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/political-stock-exchange-raje-rajasthan-chouhan-axis-my-india-1334767-2018-09-07&lt;/a&gt; found that the political stocks of Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhra Raje have dipped sharply while her BJP counterparts in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh still remain the popular choice to lead their states. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the survey of the three poll-bound states, as many as 48 per cent of the respondents wanted a change of guard in Rajasthan, with only 32 per cent expressing satisfaction with the incumbent Raje government. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan emerged as the favourite of 46 per cent of voters while 32 per cent supported the Congress party's Jyotiraditya Scindia as the next Chief Minister of the state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Chhattisgarh PSE report showed 41 per cent of respondents favouring incumbent Raman Singh as the next Chief Minister, while state Congress President Bhupesh Baghel got 21 per cent support.</news:description>

      <news:title>Liqvd Asia selected agency on record for all five GBTL brands</news:title>
      <news:description>Digital marketing agency Liqvd Asia has won the duties for the five brands under home-grown textile brand GBTL (formerly known Grasim Bhiwani Textiles Ltd).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The brands that the agency will be handling are Donear, Grado, Graviera, D’cot and NXG. The account was won after a multi-agency pitch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;GBTL, which was the poly-viscose suiting fabrics subsidiary of Grasim Industries (a part of the Aditya Birla Group), was acquired by Mumbai-based Donear Group in August last year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Liqvd Asia has already started working with the brand for their first campaign-- a TVC for Grado featuring Amitabh Bachchan. GBTL has also roped in actors such as Hrithik Roshan and Sushant Singh Rajput for its other brands and will be coming up with their campaigns soon, while also associating with upcoming sports leagues like the Asia Cup.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the win, Arnab Mitra, Managing Director, Liqvd Asia, said, “The GBTL win is a very big deal for us. We have a huge mandate to take all these five brands to newer heights. Associating with the legendary Amitabh Bachchan and even the others is a great respect. We are hopeful we will be able to make a difference in the brand building process.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TVC&amp;nbsp;Grado featuring Amitabh Bachchan  &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bLTwdjATmGM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>WhatsApp is now available on JioPhone</news:title>
      <news:description>Jio was launched two years ago to empower every Indian with the power of data. In less than two years, Jio garnered a subscriber base of over 215 million users, creating a world record of sorts.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;While it was evident that most of the 4G smartphone users were adopting Jio and enjoying the world-class services at the lowest price anywhere in the world, a large majority of the feature phone users that constitute two-third of the Indian mobile user base were being left out.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Even though the services became affordable, this segment of 500 million feature phone users could not afford even an entry level 4G smartphone. This gave birth to the JioPhone, which was launched by Reliance Retail Ltd in August 2017.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Mr. Akash Ambani, Director, Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited, said, “During this movement of connecting the unconnected, many partners came forward to strengthen the cause. One such partner who has really stood by us from the beginning is Facebook and its ecosystem. The result of one such partnership is out for the world to see today. We will be providing WhatsApp, the most used chat application in the world, on all JioPhones starting today. Jio wants to thank the Facebook and WhatsApp team for making this happen.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;After successful completion of the trials, for the first time, WhatsApp will be available for JioPhone across India. WhatsApp built a new version of its private messaging app for JioPhone, running the Jio-KaiOS, to give people a simple, reliable, and secure way to communicate with friends and family.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The new app offers the best of WhatsApp including fast and reliable messaging and the ability to send photos and videos — all end-to-end encrypted. It is also easy to record and send voice messages with just couple taps on the keypad. To get started, JioPhone users only need to verify their phone number and then they can begin chatting with other WhatsApp users one-on-one or in groups.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;“Millions of people across India can now use WhatsApp private messaging on the best-in-class JioPhone across India,” said Mr. Chris Daniels, Vice President, WhatsApp. “By designing this new app for KaiOS, we hope to expand the ability for people to communicate with anyone in India and around the world by offering the best messaging experience possible to JioPhone users.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;WhatsApp will be available on the JioPhone AppStore starting 10th September, 2018 and will be rolled out on all JioPhones by 20th September, 2018&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On being made available on the JioPhone, users can download WhatsApp on both the JioPhone and the JioPhone 2 by visiting the AppStore and clicking on download.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Reliance Retail has created a special helpline number ‘1991’ to answer queries on the JioPhone.</news:description>

      <news:title>Design thinking provides an extra edge in relating to the customer: Rahul Ramachandran</news:title>
      <news:description>There has been an abrupt outpouring of concerns over privacy implications of customers across platforms. With emerging technologies and constant use of social media, the majority of the consumers are becoming pessimistic when it comes to tracking their customer journey. With recent privacy scams and other issues, it is proven that a product's success is not only about innovation, but also about how a brand maintains their systems in place, handles data, stays ahead of their competitors and satisfies the buyer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keeping in mind of all these aspects, the consumer only gets more apprehensive of the values, pushing towards minimising risks and building online trust. With each and every device connected to the monstrous growth of IoT, this has widened the grey area of digital marketing. Marketing has been making a subtle change from a customer centric ideology to a data centric entity. This hyper targeting shift in paradigm has highly put into question the intent of marketers. Is it improving the customer experience or just refining monetary optimisation of marketing campaigns? The ethical barriers have become more and more irrelevant. We are in an era of a digital marketplace where there is hardly any differentiation between products and marketing is highly situational. There is a great hype about how each brand strategizes about customer centricity, but hardly does anything about it. The customers have grown sick of the marketers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is where the model of design thinking might actually fit marketing. Design thinking is the process which aims to solve a problem in human centric ways by brainstorming, ideating, prototyping and testing,&amp;nbsp; to understand&amp;nbsp;the human element in the problem. And on the other hand, customer centricity is an organisational effort, and not a technological data driven challenge. The customer seldom differentiates between the functional groups of a brand and this resonates the need for a design thinking approach towards problem solving in marketing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The concept of customisation makes more sense in terms of digital marketing when the brand consumer interaction is at its personal best. In such an advantageous position Design Thinking fits perfectly in understanding customers and creating futuristic innovative solutions. Well, the budgetary advantages do provide an edge for the digital marketing platform over conventional modes in understanding the customer needs and creative solutions, but by empathising and finding innovative ways to actually engage with the customer in an uncontrolled environment can provide better solutions on brand building.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The digital market has closed the gap in marketer-customer interactions with multiple platforms enabling such dialogues and providing clear/honest feedback about the product or campaign. The diversity showcased is unlike anything in the past, where you can actually get into the finest level of detailing with the data available and come up with creative ways to engage the customer and address them individually rather blasting them with emails and communications which are based on computer generated data. Well, if there is anything that digital marketers have learnt over the years, it is that there is no formula for virality (success). No matter what your data said, there is always a customer putting your mails in spam.&lt;br&gt;The complexities of understanding a customer requires a cross functional approach and asking the right questions. There is a great need on the consumer side to interact with the brands without actually yielding from them the invasive details of their behaviour. Imagine having your customers, HR, Finance &amp;amp; IT people along with the marketers on the same team trying to create a new campaign. The perspectives, ideas and opinions that the cross-functional team brings to the table will help in accurate definition of problems and creative ways of handling such problems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given such a thesis to work on, it only makes sense to prototype, test, implement and improvise to get it right rather than adhering to a single strategy based on data. Digital Marketers rely too much on data, that they actually believe that changing the colour of the call to action button directly impacts the sale of product. It might be true at a marginal level, but concentrating too much on such data driven models takes the life out of the creative models that are required in marketing. Breakthroughs and innovations cannot be achieved by data based models, but by adapting to creative models. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Design thinking methodologies will provide you with that extra edge in relating to the customer in a better way than what the predictive models of data suggest, and gives you ample space to innovate, test and improve. The normal approach in moving to the customers and to ask what they want does not provide you with futuristic views of new products or solutions, but rather incremental benefits to what exists today for the immediate future. Design thinking quickly enables you to creatively come up with futuristic solutions to problems that may not exist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This becomes the first step of any innovation. Marketers have to come out of the mindset of creative thinking which worked best for them in the past and instead, be open to new and creative problem solving techniques and innovative ideas to identify and execute futuristic and long term exercises. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rahul Ramachandran is Manager – Branding, Social Media and Alumni Relations, Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Disclaimer: The views expressed here are solely those of the author and do not in any way represent the views of exchange4media.com)&lt;/em&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>We will continue to deepen and widen our presence in regional: Sudhanshu Vats, Viacom18</news:title>
      <news:description>Regional is the new national, Sudhanshu Vats, Group CEO, Viacom18, had said earlier.&amp;nbsp; Going by his&amp;nbsp;views, the network on Monday announced the launch of its new regional movie channel Colors Kannada Cinema. The 24-hour movie channel will go on air on September 24.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming after Rishtey Cineplex, Colors Kannada Cinema highlights the network’s expansion within the movie broadcast category and strengthens its regional presence. The total adex of the Kannada market is Rs 600-700 crore and the movie segment has a share of&amp;nbsp;14 per cent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the launch and how regional is driving the growth, Vats explained, “Regional is the new national. And with a strong preference for cultural shows in India, the&amp;nbsp;language&amp;nbsp;genre will continue to be very strong. We will continue to deepen and widen our presence in regional. We will continue to expand in new languages and geographies and also in the markets where we already have a presence.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He elaborated, “Regional is now unquestionably growing, considerably faster than national. My own sense is that this momentum will continue. As we measure deeper, you will see that indexation of regional will go up further. Close to 59 per cent people communicate in regional languages. The share of viewership is still 50 per cent and there is a considerable amount of tailwind.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Also, these languages, particularly down South, are of areas that have high income indexation. So there is every reason that viewership will continue to grow and also the monetization of that viewership will continue to grow. Therefore, the yields should improve because a lot of eyeballs are sitting in relatively better off and well-off India. Income indexation of these markets are also higher. We will continue to do investment as we go forward.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A recent report launched by KPMG-- The Media Ecosystem: The Walls falls down-- also mentioned that regional languages will drive the growth.</news:description>

      <news:title>I want to build the best think tank team at Initiative: Vaishali Verma, CEO</news:title>
      <news:description>Vaishali Verma has taken charge as the Chief Executive Officer of Initiative, part of the Interpublic Group’s media management network IPG Mediabrands in the month of April. Verma who has over 22 years of experience in the area of marketing, media, and advertising has added three new businesses to Initiative’s account within months of her joining.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interaction with exchange4media, Verma spoke about her transition from COO of Lodestar UM and Initiative to CEO of Initiative, and her vision for the media agency and more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpts: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Initiative has won a barrage of accounts already. If that’s anything to go by, what is in store for Initiative in 2018?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;2018 is a year of both consolidation and new business acquisitions. I'm very proud that we have added three businesses in the last couple of months, which is Dish TV, Indigo Paints, and Anchor Electricals. We are a people driven industry and it is very important for us to strengthen the leadership at Initiative. Arun Sharma has been elevated as Chief Operating Officer for the Delhi region and Laya Menon has been appointed as Executive Vice President and she will take the mandate of Initiative South and we are also looking to take somebody on board for the west. So, 2018 is a year in which I want to have my leadership team completely in place, and expanding our clientele will be the focus for 2019. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From COO of Lodestar UM and Initiative to CEO of Initiative, tell us about the changes and challenges you faced during this transition?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are lot of changes that I have had to face during this transition. From being a regional head to a national head and becoming responsible for a lot of people is a big change. There is a vast variety of clients and you have to hold on to the relationships. I am trying to get onto the role as I'm still transitioning out of my current role of South Head. It is a slow process and being based in Bangalore is helping me do that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming the to challenges, there is none, I see those as opportunities for my growth of taking Initiative as the go-to agency.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have recently stated that the advertising business is going through the most interesting times. Could you elaborate on this with some examples?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are in the business of media planning and so we need to understand how consumers are consuming media. The entertainment and media industries have grown many folds in the recent years. People are now shifting from watching media to watching content. So, they have become platform agnostic. The content can be viewed on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar or could be on Star Sports, the content is watched irrespective of which media it could be on. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The way that consumers are consuming content is changing dramatically, a lot of content gets consumed on your hand-held phones and other parallel platforms. So, when you do planning, it would be a media agnostic planning. I would try to reach that consumer, irrespective of whichever media he or she consumes, so it could be a little bit of OTT platforms, TV or print media. That is what I meant by saying that it's an interesting time where you no longer can do a TV plan and can just sit with it, the planning should be layered with digital. It needs to have a video platform, there is proliferation of media which is happening. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Similarly, why has it become more difficult now to get the consumer's attention? Is it because they are too many players in the field or the consumer’s demands are becoming more varied and too difficult to meet?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is only 24 hours in a day and today we want to do much more than we ever did earlier. We get these interesting insights while talking to today’s youth; they have their hobbies, they need to pursue their social life and then the time which is left to consume media is very limited. The media consumption is at the consumer’s discretion. It could be a metro phenomenon. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to me, lot of data and research will have to come into play to really understand when a consumer is receptive to advertisements. The biggest challenge is not reaching the customers, but about engaging them. To tackle this, we have lot of tools at Initiative. Our data science team work day and night to solve this issue, we have a Consumer Panel Study which is our proprietary tool that gives us a lot of insight and maps 77 touch points. It is a very large study as big as TGI. So that layered with lot of Analytics tools help us get inputs to plan to the changing consumer behaviour. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Industry witnessed a sluggish start to the festive season because of the Kerala floods, what are your expectations on advertisement spends by brands for this year’s festive season? How are the brands preparing for the season?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We saw Onam being washed away by the floods. Normally a lot of festive investments happens in the Kerala market across all media by FMCGs and lot of retail brands during Onam, but this year there has been a drop in that because of the floods. Apart from that, the tempo is as high as last year. Yes, the start to the festive season is a little late as the festive season will begin in mid-September. This time we have a shorter festive window. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brands are gearing up for the festive season and we are in the planning stage right now. The investments are not increasing over last year's hence, the challenge is far higher. There are a lot of learnings which we have acquired over the years about festive reactions. We map the festival calendar of the media landscape and then align our campaigns to it. Not much changes have happened in the media landscape during the festive seasons for past couple of years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One thing that evokes my interest is the entire growth of OTT platforms. OTT platforms are coming up with Indian originals and it is interesting to know whether they have any new line-ups during the festive season or do the OTT platform change their calendar during the festive seasons. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest challenges that the media industry is facing now? Recently there were discussions around clients calling pitches more frequently. Do you think it is affecting the client-agency relationship?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yes, it is affecting the client-agency relationship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bigger clients review business every 3 to 5 years. I am also a firm believer that for you to understand the client business and build relationships it takes time. Sometimes you develop the rapport and build that relationship, and there is a pitch. It has always been the trade of the business. Contracts are signed that way. But, the change does not always mean you get better, clients change because the promises during the pitch seems attractive and later they realise they are not getting it. I am happy with the clients I have been working with, there have been pitches and we have retained pitches as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The mantra for me is product, people, and process. You need to get all three to work together and I think we have delivered that and that's the reason why I am happy with what is there.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a woman leader, what is the legacy you want to leave behind?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to bring in a lot of inclusion and diversity to the organisation. When I say diversity it is not only based on gender but across all forms, and it could even be people from various backgrounds and different industry verticals. I want Initiative to be differentiated from any other typical media agency. The second is, I want Initiative to be a sought-after agency. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As the CEO what is your vision for Initiative? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to build the best think tank team at Initiative, the vision is to build that kind of an organisation which has diverse skill sets so that you are really differentiated and become the go-to agency for any client.</news:description>

      <news:title>Vodafone-Idea merger: What will be Jio's next move?</news:title>
      <news:description>Two years ago, when India's richest businessman Mukesh Ambani launched Reliance Jio, the Indian mobile industry was thrown into a turmoil. With an audacious free service for the rest of 2016, followed by vastly cheaper data plans and free voice calls for life, Jio had hit the right chord. It still continues to do so with JioPhone, a 4G feature phone for the masses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jio forced rivals to dramatically slash their tariffs to retain their users. Also, its customer acquisition strategy helped it grow its 4G subscriber base to 215 million in just a little over a year-and-a-half of its existence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, the recent Vodafone-Idea (VI) merger is believed to have more than doubled the subscriber-related incentives offered to retailers. As the war for customers intensifies, the merged brand has thrown down the gauntlet at rival Reliance Jio Infocomm. So the big question now is: What will be the next move of the two-year-old disruptor?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dialing Up Success&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536722327_E5tZfj_jio-modi.jpg" style="width:443px;height:254px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A day after Ambani kicked-off his company’s ambitious telecom venture, India woke up to full front-page advertisements. By evening, the television advertisements had started. A ninety-second clip comprising images of India’s most famous icons: Swami Vivekanand, Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore and Mother Teresa had hit the screens. This gave way to a video showing a&amp;nbsp;portion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech that year, where he spoke of his government’s Digital India programme and how it will uplift India. The final portion of the video linked Reliance Jio’s aims specifically with Digital India, and said&amp;nbsp;how the service will connect India’s 1.2 billion people with free voice calls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The video looked clever, with no specific talks of a product or product launch. The brand tried to play it off as a dedication to Digital India. And from then on, Reliance Jio has undertaken an aggressive marketing strategy to create positive brand awareness. It has launched ad campaigns on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, billboards and social media platforms including Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. It knows the importance of star power and has roped in several celebrities to act in its commercials and be associated with its brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan, who is also the brand ambassador of Jio, kickstarted the launch event which took place at Reliance Corporate Park in Navi Mumbai, along with other celebrities such as musician A R Rahman, actors Ranbir Kapoor and Javed Jaffrey, and filmmaker Rajkumar Hirani.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brand then launched Jio Football, featuring seven film actors and 29 footballers which was a follow up of last year's 'Jio DhanDhanaDhan' campaign. This was Jio Studios' first major campaign for the teleco. Then Bollywood actress Deepika Padukone was talking up India’s dominance in mobile data in an IPL special Jio campaign, making it the second most visible brand on television.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWOdhK4c1tA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/77xaEK2Elz4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War&amp;nbsp;to intensify?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to recent rumours, Reliance Jio Infocomm (Jio) and US-based Cisco Systems are likely to extend their partnership to tap the ₹50,000-crore strong enterprise market with services portfolio that&amp;nbsp;the Mukesh Ambani-owned telco plans to launch shortly. With the recent merger of&amp;nbsp;Vodafone India and Idea Cellular, it looks like the new entity too&amp;nbsp;is now preparing to tap into the ₹50,000-crore strong enterprise market pie dominated by Bharti Airtel and state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anita Nayyar - CEO India &amp;amp; South Asia - Havas Media Group, opines that while the Vodafone-Idea merger will create a strong competition, the category thrives on consumer benefits and that’s where the comparisons will happen between Jio and VI. “Reliance has always created a disruption in the market place, whether when they launched Garden Vareli or when they launched Jio. Jio is tuning out to be a strong brand given the exposure and the consumer benefit it is offering,” says Nayyar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashish Mishra, MD, Interbrand India, an agency that worked closely with Reliance to define and design brand Jio, opines that Jio has been strategically created to be a lot more than a telecom brand. And so, it’s comparison to another telecom brand is unfair. Mishra believes that a strong offering emerging in the sector will challenge the duopoly of the two leading brands in the market, Jio and Airtel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The telecom wars will have to be fought at two polarised ends of the value chain: for broad-basing and still optimising penetration and&amp;nbsp;beginning to create a premium for viability. Technology and value will thus be the drivers,” he lets out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Borja Borrero, Executive Director, EMEA &amp;amp; Latin America, Interbrand, who has also briefly worked on brand Jio, says that he was challenged by the brief to them. Borrero was involved in sourcing the international creative team in creating the brand identity. “The first thing with Jio was that we wanted to create an international creative team to work with the brand because we wanted to create one iconic brand for India that can be a disruptor and be relevant even beyond the boundaries of India. The brand wanted to change everything in no time. So we had to be agile, flexible and very fast,” he reveals. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vineet Sodhani, CEO, Spatial Access, feels that the merger is relatively small and quite preliminary in the overall context of the industry and its potential. He sees it as a 3C game of carriage, content and commerce. “We are largely discussing carriage here. Brand recall for Jio remains high with regular investments on media properties and it will take time for the Voda-Idea merger to settle anyways. Furthermore, Jio feature phones are the new growth drivers for the brand which will help keep&amp;nbsp; the brand recall high,” he shares.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mishra points out that as regards to Vodafone-Idea, they still&amp;nbsp;have to work around the natural conflicts of two cultures coming together-- of sorting out their overlaps and complementarities-- which would define&amp;nbsp;how they will be architected together. He contends that due to an extended merger time-frame, there’s been uncertainty around both these brands which surely would have affected their brand values.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;“While Idea was championing democratisation at the lower end, Vodafone had an edge on the premium side. So they have a potential to complement each other and be a complete portfolio in the sector. Jio, on the other hand, has been designed to play at both the ends as a single brand. Unless the play at the premium and technology end is made the hero for the brand, the prevailing subscription game will result in the Reliance’s image of value getting reinforced.&amp;nbsp;So it’s a fairly evenly poised match with less room for error, going forward for both the players,” he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brand expert Gaurav Gulati feels that the merger of Vodafone and Idea will&amp;nbsp;build a brand that is for everyone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Vodafone as a brand is known for its marketing and advertising magic and now has a power of two. Vodafone has a stronger reach in urban areas whereas Idea has reach in rural areas. This combined positioning and unique brand identities will build a brand that is for everyone and has a broader reach,” he says.</news:description>

      <news:title>Our priority in India is not the market share: Shunyan Zhu, President, UCWeb</news:title>
      <news:description>Alibaba Group owned mobile platform UCWeb has witnessed significant growth since its launch in India few years back. With over 130 million monthly active users, India has become the largest overseas market outside China for the company. The company is planning to make significant investments this year in the Indian market given the scope that it offers. On a short visit to India, Shunyan Zhu, President, UCWeb at Alibaba Digital Media &amp;amp; Entertainment Group spoke about the group’s India journey and how the company is looking to handle competition posed by players like Facebook and Google.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the video here or read the excerpts below:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKlDs8AxmqM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important is India as a market for UCWeb?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;India is definitely one of the important overseas markets for Alibaba Group and UCWeb. UCWeb has been in the country for a long time. We established our first India office in 2011, most importantly; we have already established a large user base. Globally we have 430 million monthly active users and in India alone we have 130 million monthly active users. So definitely this is one of the most important countries for us considering all the great potential of this country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would you call your biggest achievements in the Indian market so far? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actually there are two biggest achievements with regard to the Indian market. The first is the product which has got encouraging response from the users, and that is definitely something we value the most. Although we have a very large user base here, we have been constantly innovating on our product here, which is the UC Browser. The second part is about localisation. More than 80 per cent of our employees here are Indians and that is something we are really proud of. We rely heavily on local talent to make the product bigger and I think it is another big achievement for us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the biggest challenges faced by content publishers in today’s market environment?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We do believe that the content publishing industry is the future trend and that is part of the reason we are focusing big on this industry. Having said this, we have dealt with some barriers. For example, India is a country with huge diversity in terms of culture and languages. This diversity for all content publishers is a big challenge. Moreover, as a publisher, this country requires a lot of localisation and that is yet another challenge for us and for every player in this business and we are constantly innovating to deal with such challenges.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the content publishing ecosystem is witnessing a sort of monopoly, with players like Facebook and Google dominating it to a large extent?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We think there is no absolute monopoly in the industry. The reasons are: in the content publishing business the user needs are very diversified in terms of language, formats etc. Also the industry has been growing very fast especially with the availability of low cost data and smartphones. At UC our priority in India is not the market share, instead we are focused on meeting consumer’s needs and our belief is that if we can meet consumer needs in the fast changing market landscape, we can definitely get the expected market share that we want. So first of all we have to build a very healthy content ecosystem to make this pie bigger. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you define your India strategy going forth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Innovation is in UC’s genes. We keep innovating based on local users’ needs. Our strategy is ‘glocal’— to bring global resources and insights and then focus on localisation. Our big strategy for this fiscal also is to expand in the South of the country as it is one of the fastest growing markets for content publishers in India.</news:description>

      <news:title>Ownership change will not stop us from doing good business: Richard Ingleton, Kantar</news:title>
      <news:description>Somehow, market research has always been associated with survey. But Richard Ingleton, Group CEO of Kantar Insights, wants to change this perception. The industry needs to understand that market research is not just about survey data, it is about any data, he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In today’s data-driven world, marketers have lost count of the types of data they are exposed to. And this is where market research plays an important role. But its role, obviously, goes beyond that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a freewheeling chat with exchange4media, Ingleton explains the role of market research and the purpose of recently formed Kantar Analytics Practise. He also talks about key trends with regards to market analytics, talks of Kantar being sold out and where does India stand when it comes to big data: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j7Wgnt5TJfo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are the edited excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kantar Analytics Practice unifies a global network of over 1500 data scientists. Analytics consultants integrate Kantar's unique consumer insights, based on the world’s largest first-party data sets, with clients’ own customer data. What’s its aim?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aim of Kantar Analytics is to bring more awareness to the market and more awareness internally about our ability to work with not just survey data but with any data (sales, transactional or social media) for analytics. People tend to look at us as a survey company. But analytics can work across all&amp;nbsp;data. As long as it is data, you can put it to common repository, you can clean it, you can analyse it and you can get the answer. &lt;br&gt;There are multiple places where data is stored. We want to get to all those places. The purpose of market survey is to understand human beings. Survey is not the only way of doing that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kantar has been in the news with WPP's leadership undergoing a complete overhaul. Please comment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have got a really good business, whether it’s the different data source we have or the ability to work across different solutions such as analytics, research or consulting. We have a very good market reach. Whoever owns us,&amp;nbsp;doesn’t stop us from being good business. We just look forward to who that will be. Whatever happens, there are relationships with sister companies in WPP that are quite useful to us and we would like to retain them in some way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When it comes to big data where does India stand?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The promise of technology is always greater than what it delivers. It’s not about how big the data is, it’s about how right the data is to solve the problem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;India, for a long time, has been one of the most thoughtful societies when it comes to market research. There are barriers to doing some of the latest stuff in the form of cost. What’s affordable to a US client, UK client or a French client may not be so for an Indian client. People have to be quite clever around the tools that are used to keep the cost down. So Indian market research is right up there with the best in the world, but has to be a little more creative in terms of the way they get their answers and because of the cost barriers, particularly around the use of technology. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is so much happening across the globe with regard to data privacy-- there is GDPR in EU and even India is now very aggressive about data protection. What is your take on this since digital, data and privacy must now be balanced at your end?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s an interesting issue because different societies have different views on this. Most of the data we use is either permissioned or anonymous or both. In terms of our everyday business, it does not have a big impact. But then if you look at society’s attitude, for instance in Germany, it’s very strict. In China, the attitude to privacy is up to government. India is somewhere in the middle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important is it for a marketer to take sides in the present day situation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking sides as marketers is becoming more dangerous than ever because it can lead to alienation. This is an interesting question for marketers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In today's world, what are client's immediate demands?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s true in every professional service. ‘I would like it to be faster, better and cheaper.’ I am fine with the demands as long as they are invested with us in doing them properly. The brand has to be very clear of what they want. If they are not clear of what they want, how are we going to do it faster, better and cheaper? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does the future of market research look?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s looking positive. Every business, since the beginning, needed to understand its market base. The way you understand customer is now harder than ever. There are multiple data sources. Opinions are becoming polarised. The nature of customers is changing. I think we are more valuable and needed than we have ever been. That’s the positive. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My main concern is that industry and clients associate market research with surveys. I would like them to remember that market research is market research regardless of the tools we use. As long as clients remember that, it’s a healthy future for the industry.</news:description>

      <news:title>Watch: Digital evolution cannot happen without quality content: Sunil Kataria</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Initiative by Bloomberg Quint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Content marketing has come to shape digital marketing strategies for brands across product categories. Technology has made content distribution easier and disrupted paradigms of marketing to consumers on digital. Be it a social media post, a digital video ad or branded content, a strong content strategy is crucial to any brand that wishes to have a digital presence. Increasingly, regional content is becoming the focus of this strategy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Sunil Kataria CEO, India &amp;amp; SAARC, Godrej Consumer Products Limited, regional content will drive the next wave of digital in India. Missing out on creating content in local languages is not something brands can afford, says Kataria. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He spoke to exchange4media about the evolution of content marketing and digital content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited Excerpts&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has branded content evolved over the years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The biggest transition has been in the awareness that digital evolution cannot happen without quality content and more specifically regional content. The other transition is that it is not about single language masters, but multiple language masters and quicker turnaround time. These are putting a lot of pressure on the ecosystem and the marketing teams to keep pace. But it is also giving us an idea of how to connect and engage with digital audiences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the key aspects of a good content strategy?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first and foremost hallmark of a good content strategy is that it has to connect with audience and engage with audience in their local and native language. I think the rise of Indic content consumption holds the key to a good marketing strategy within content. Within that, the form and duration of the content does not matter, it is content engagement that matters. Therefore the best form I believe is storytelling. If you can narrate strong, good, connected stories it forms the backbone of a strong content strategy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does content marketing help reduce overall marketing costs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do not think there is a direct correlation between content marketing and a reduction in marketing costs. In the initial stages, where the industry is right now, the cost could be even higher. Content marketing is boundary-less. The life of a content asset is much lower than a TV asset. So assets get multiplied, their duration get shorter and timelines become shorter as well. So initially brand owners may need to invest in multiple creatives, multiple genres and platforms. Hence, it is very difficult to say whether content marketing can today can save you costs on the overall marketing plan. What it can definitely do it give you much greater engagement quality, if done right. As scale and localisation takes place, cost will come down. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is digital overshadowing traditional content marketing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I don’t think so. Even though digital marketing spends are growing at the highest pace among all constituents, the fact is TV is projected to grow at a healthy rate, the strength of print has not declined. So I guess there will be space for all these three mediums - TV, print and digital. Digital will grow specially on the back of regional content.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XHiIhSRsuEY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;</news:description>

Some of these solutions were new advertising products designed specifically for India and Indian small businesses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kim Spalding, Lead- Product Management for the SMB and Emerging Market Advertising, Google, spoke to exchange4media about the new solutions, and why getting small businesses online is critical for Google’s Next Billion programme. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the video here or read the excerpts below:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QU51hJDGEig" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It has been 18 years since Google Ad Solutions were launched. What has been the biggest change in what Google offers today?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot has changed in the last 18 years. We started with Google Ads on Search and helping advertisers connect with Google users through Search. Now, we have Google Search, maps, videos, display and other products that can help advertisers connect with consumers across their entire journey on the internet - that is probably the biggest change. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has this changed the way businesses leverage digital for marketing?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As people are using mobile phones to use and access the web, they are looking for local information that is relevant to them. We see users looking for information like ‘stores near me’ and they want to know if that store is open right now and what products are available in that store. It is all about giving immediate, local, and accessible information to users. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google recently revamped its marketing solutions, why was this revamp needed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two reasons: First, we wanted to reflect this two-decade journey going from helping advertisers access users on Google Search to helping them across the entire user journey across many different platforms. Second: We wanted to reflect our vision for simplicity. Google Adwords to Google Ads.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In India, spend on digital advertising is 15-20 per cent&amp;nbsp;of the total ad pie, what is holding advertisers back from spending on digital and how do you tackle the challenges?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We at Google are focussed on helping advertisers get the most out of the various platforms. I can imagine digital being complex for first-timers. But we find that once advertisers and marketers try digital marketing and witness the transparency and results it offers, they opt for it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indian marketers are a diverse group. Many in India are coming to digital for the first time. Large companies are using digital and taking advantage of everything that it has to offer. But we are seeing more and more business trying digital marketing for the first time and experimenting with digital and benefiting from it. I do see a lot of growth in that space. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say that a lot of businesses are trying digital for the first time, how is Google helping small businesses get online? Also, how crucial is engaging small businesses for getting the Next Billion Users online? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are 51 million small businesses in India alone. Small businesses are absolutely critical for our Next Billion Users efforts. It is really important for us to serve them well and get them online. Secondly, we know that the internet is richer when small businesses are engaged. So to help serve our Next Billion Users well, we need to have all the small businesses online and promote them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have launched a new product called Smart Campaigns which is focused on helping small businesses get online and up and running with ads quickly. It is an easy and simple to use ad solution. We know that small businesses that are online grow at twice the pace of their offline peers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, small businesses in India are what inspired us to create automated landing pages. Because so many of them did not have websites; it was a problem we wanted to solve. We wanted to create a landing page for them and also ensure it is tailored for their ad creative. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The other important investment is in Indic languages. A lot of small businesses are working within their communities, so it is important that we have solutions for them that are available in all the relevant local Indian languages. Google Ads now support Tamil, Bengali and Telugu across Search, Display Network and YouTube, Google. Soon, we will also support Marathi. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We developed one of our latest solutions ‘Form Ads’ for India first. We built it from the insights that we received from marketers and consumers in India. Ninety per cent of consumers are on mobile, they don't want to type on their mobiles. All they want to do is tap and swipe. Form Ads on Search allows advertisers to generate leads seamlessly from their mobile search ads. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the steps to get online for SMBs? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Small businesses can first get online using a free tool called Google My Business. This helps small businesses get a free listing on Google Search and Google Maps. Once they are established with a digital presence and are ready to start promoting their business, it is a great opportunity to use smart campaigns to start advertising online. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think SMBs are comfortable with using self-serve ad solutions? If they need to use an agency to help with navigating the platform, then is the point of self-serve lost?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some businesses are very comfortable with self-serve solutions like Smart Campaigns, while others prefer to work with agencies - that’s great as well. We work extensively with agencies to help them have the right ad solutions to help them support small and medium businesses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firstly, agencies often do a lot to support small businesses. They help them think about creatives and sometimes help them think about their entire marketing solutions. Secondly, the simplicity in Smart Campaigns helps agencies as well. Agencies are often trying to support a wide variety of small businesses. The simpler we make the campaign for them, the more the agencies can do to support the small business.</news:description>

      <news:title>ICMA 2018: Content creators should be original and have good work ethic: Industry experts</news:title>
      <news:description>The entertainment industry has been consistently creating and delivering engaging content for hundreds of years. And so, the question remains — how can content marketers apply the lessons of certain strategies and macro-trends to their content creation? At e4m Content Jam, part of the Indian Content Marketing Awards 2018, a Celebrity Chat, chaired by Annurag Batra, Chairman &amp;amp; Editor-In-Chief, exchange4media on the topic of 'Content Marketing Lessons from Entertainment Industry' delved into this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speakers at this session were Rannvijay Singh, Film Actor &amp;amp; TV Star; Anupama Chopra, Film Critic; Bollywood actor Sonu Sood, renowned YouTuber Bhuvan Bam, Amit Golani, Executive Creative Director, The Viral Fever (TVF) and Amit Wadhwani, Director, Sai Estate Consultant Pvt. Ltd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Answering the question on whether there are any rules for creating content, Chopra said that to her, the rules of making content are to be original. “Be true to who you are. You don’t have to play by the abiding rules. Experiment and figure out,” she advised. Singh and Bam echoed similar sentiments. “Content was never about competition. There is an audience for all kinds of content, which you need to figure out,” said Bam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Singh opined that you don’t know what will work, but it shouldn’t stop you from experimenting. “It depends on who you are and what you want to do with it,” he shared. Sood contended that today small screen is the big screen. “Today people are looking at it in big ways and do what they want to do with the help of it. This digital exposure also helps you learn what works best for you,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Singh asserted that while creating content, it’s imperative to bear in mind the need to adapt content according to the societal circumstances. Chopra shared that while creating content, at times it is best to mix different formats up. “There are some conversations that require the depth and inversion,” she opened up.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While advising content-creators and brand owners, experts expressed the need for content-creators to be authentic and have a work ethic while brand-owners should refrain from hard-selling. Said Sood, “Be original, don’t chase success, work hard and it happens. To brand-owners, I would say be true to yourself and keep away from the tendency to over-sell your brand or offering."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bam decoded that patience in the digital space is the key. “It might take you five hours, five days or five years to get viral. The clue is to just be patient and keep working hard,” he said. Chopra said that content-creators and brands must have a work ethic. “You’ve got to keep at it. To brands, I would say, don’t insist on hard-sell,” she stated. Wadhwani also agreed to this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Golani feels that for the content-creators, they need to keep in mind that there is no fixed formula. “All we can do is do hard-work. Brand owners are going in the positive direction but I feel they shouldn’t shy away from experimenting," he said.</news:description>

      <news:title>Alibaba's Jack Ma has stepped down, names the CEO as successor</news:title>
      <news:description>Alibaba co-founder and executive chairman, Jack Ma, one of China's biggest tech titans has stepped down. The group’s CEO, Daniel Zhang, will succeed Ma as chairman next year. Ma will continue serving as a board member until its annual general shareholders’ meeting in 2020.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alibaba confirmed that Ma would continue as chairman of the company for 12 months, before handing the chairmanship over to current CEO Daniel Zhang. This is in order to "ensure a smooth transition”. Ma said the reason he's leaving is to pursue philanthropic endeavours focused on education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ma co-founded Alibaba with 17 other people in 1999. He helped build it into a $420 billion company with more than 500 million Chinese customers who use the site to purchase everything from clothes to cement. Alibaba now also handles digital payments, online banking, cloud computing and digital media and entertainment.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the course of his tenure, Ma became China's richest man, earning a net worth of more than $40 billion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The press release included a letter from Ma to Alibaba customers and shareholders, wherein he stated, "put a lot of thought and preparation into this succession plan for ten years. As for myself, I still have lots of dreams to pursue. Those who know me know that I do not like to sit idle ... I also want to return to education, which excites me with so much blessing because this is what I love to do. The world is big, and I am still young, so I want to try new things – because what if new dreams can be realised?!"</news:description>

      <news:title>Dancing Shiva brings 'Still About Section 377' live to SonyLIV app</news:title>
      <news:description>Mumbai based production house Dancing Shiva, having forayed into the web space, has released the country's first transgeneder series called 'Still About Section 377' on their youtube channel. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first episode has gone live on their channel and all 9 episodes will be available for viewing on OTT platform- SonyLiv (App) on 11th September 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;'Still About Section 377' is the second season of the popular and much talked about web series 'All About Section 377'. The story of 'Still About Section 377' focuses on acceptance, and charts the journey of an urban gay couple who goes to the village in order to convince the family of one of the partners to accept their relationship. It also highlights the myths people have about the LGBTQ community, and the story hence focuses on breaking those myths as well as educating masses on how one should not be judgmental.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The web series stars Amit Khanna, Gulshan Nain, Ankita Bhatiya, Gunjan Malhotra, and Yash Yogi as the main protagonists and is directed by Amit Khanna. The dialogues are written by Niranjan Iyenger, along with Amit Khanna.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anuya Chauhan Kudecha, Founder of Dancing Shiva Productions said, "When Amit Khanna first came to us with the script, we loved his writing and since we truely belived in the concept, we wanted to go ahead with it. Still About Section 377 is about acceptance, and portrays the emotional aspects of a Gay couple. All the 9 episodes of the season will be available on SonyLiv and the 1st episode is out on Dancing Shiva's Youtube channel. We are very sure that especially after the epic ruling by the Supreme court on scrapping Section 377, the general interest on the topic amongst masses has risen and people would be open to viewing such kind of content."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the prominent features of 'Still About Section 377' is a never seen before transgender track, where the tale delves into the life of a transgender person based in a village who fights the prejudice of society and yearns to make a living. Still About Section 377 is presented by SP Cinecorp and Asmiy Entertainment and produced by Mumbai based content driven production house Dancing Shiva and Phillum Makers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Content Jam 2018: How data has become the new ally of content marketers </news:title>
      <news:description>Are content creators and brand owners relying on digital, data and technology as an ally? Does the absence of a common metric affects the digital ecosystem? Industry experts tried to analyse these and several other questions during a panel discussion at exchange4media’s second content marketing conference Content Jam on Friday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The panel comprised Ajay&amp;nbsp;Nair, COO, Only Much Louder; Kanika Mohan Saxena, Vice President-Content, Vodafone; Gurmeet Singh, former Vice President and Managing Director, Yahoo India; and Karthik Nagarajan, Chief Content Officer, Wavemaker. It was moderated by Samir Bangara, Founder &amp;amp; MD, Qyuki Digital Media. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bangara started off on the perception that online video and content marketing is the future. The discussion then went on to data science. He said, “The data science that we are talking about is deployed into taking decisions on making content (largely online video).” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bringing in Nair into the discussion, Bangara asked, “Ajay, how do you use data into core business as well as ticketed business? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nair answered, “If you look at live events, data helps us make a lot of our decisions. A lot of the insights that go into making a certain type of content are still informed by a large demographic piece of data.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kanika Mohan Saxena, Vice President-Content, Vodafone said, “As a telecom company, we sit with a lot of data. We do a lot of analytics. We know when the consumer comes on Vodafone Play app. What are they watching? What are the search words? Balaji shows do exceptionally well for us.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Saxena confessed that Reliance has changed the game for everybody. A lot of telecom providers with content are relooking at it. Her advice? “The idea is to do smart acquisition and make great content. One needs to look at habit formation, which is an interesting parameter for all the telecos.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to who is watching a particular piece of content, Gurmeet Singh, former Vice President and Managing Director of Yahoo India, said each of the players has its own DNP (data server where one has access to data on users from various sources). He said, “You get to know the kind of people watching a certain piece of content. Once you know that you can drive further, you go to the advertiser and ask who their TG is.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“For any internet business, maximum CPM/yield is from bandwidth content and the least is from programmatic. We are encouraged to have more branded content. The moment you have this in the ecosystem, you are able to measure content marketing. If you can encourage advertisers to get more content you have the required metrics (consumption rate) to scale up that and make it more meaningful,” Singh added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This moved the discussion towards the measurement of digital ecosystem (or one common metric across board) which has been in the talks for quite some time. Bangara asked the panelists, “Is there nothing we are able to use and effectively measure across all media (YouTube, Instagram etc)?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Karthik Nagarajan, Chief Content Officer, Wavemaker, considered that to be a blessing in disguise. He commented that one should be thankful of that fact (that there’s no one common metric). “There’s no common content. I don’t think there should be one common metric or we should lose sleep over it. I think it’s a more dynamic and flourishing ecosystem. There should be different metric.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nagarajan also talked about how image search has become a reality and is being used excessively in ecommerce.</news:description>

      <news:title>Content Jam 2018: From Content Silos to Content Ecosystem&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>Unlike legacy media, where a brand knew where, what, when and how its content would be seen, today brands are dependent on media scenarios that include multiple variables before any form of content is shown to a particular consumer. How then&amp;nbsp;are brands changing from focusing on self to monitoring and preparing for the big picture of where their content will be seen? How should brands identify, partner and collaborate with other ecosystem players to ensure that their content makes maximum impact&amp;nbsp;in a desired way? All this and more was answered during a panel discussion at e4m Content Jam 2018 named&amp;nbsp;From Content Silos to Content Ecosystem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536551280_iSXyAB_contentjaminside.jpg" style="border:0px  #000000;width:350px;height:193px;float:right"&gt;The session was chaired by Devendra Deshpande, Head Content Plus, Mindshare. Prachi Mohapatra, CMO, FBB, Sudhanshu Nagpal, Head- Biscuit Category, Mondelez India, Sachin Killawala, Marketing Director, Nivea India, Amitabh Pande, Deputy Marketing Manager, IKEA India and Zoya Pandey, Head- Marketing Excellence Abbott Healthcare were among the panellists. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Deshpande opened the panel discussion by talking about how things have&amp;nbsp;changed&amp;nbsp;compared to&amp;nbsp;the earlier days.&amp;nbsp;“Even earlier we had traditional mediums like print, television, radio and multiple mediums. Now we have digital but the question is, have&amp;nbsp;things really changed?” he asked.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nagpal said, “Coming from a&amp;nbsp;marketer's perspective on&amp;nbsp;how things have&amp;nbsp;evolved,&amp;nbsp;there is one rule&amp;nbsp;which remains constant-&amp;nbsp;whatever you do, consumer is at the heart of it. We need to know&amp;nbsp;what consumers&amp;nbsp;are&amp;nbsp;doing, where they are spending time and many behaviour-based&amp;nbsp;things too. Rest of the rules of marketing are changing and very fast at that. It is kind of&amp;nbsp;scary&amp;nbsp;as a marketer to keep up with the changes. But we need to know what factors are driving these&amp;nbsp;changes. Digital is growing, data is becoming cheaper and&amp;nbsp;data usage is increasing. Most importantly, the way a&amp;nbsp;consumer is consuming content whether it is news, entertainment or any information is evolving very rapidly. Our TG is more on digital platforms.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, Pandey thinks that everything has changed for marketers. “Things are changing so fast and&amp;nbsp;marketers are&amp;nbsp;really trying to keep up with the changes. With digital explosion we have far more aware and empowered customers. The challenge&amp;nbsp;is that there is so much of information because they don’t know which data is authentic and which is not. Also the whole ecosystem has become far more complex. There is also a&amp;nbsp;lot of behavioural change&amp;nbsp;happening out there.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Killawala believes that only the medium has changed but not the property. “The challenge which we have now&amp;nbsp;is how to minimise&amp;nbsp;the content to adapt to&amp;nbsp;the medium because your content and messaging has to be the same. Also, the content for every medium has to be different, it can’t be&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;same on television and YouTube."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking the&amp;nbsp;discussion further, Mohapatra, who handles a fashion brand said, "Today the consumer is different and also it's important to know&amp;nbsp;on which platform they are consuming content and how much time they are spending on each platform."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pande had a pertinent point as she&amp;nbsp;said, “Content fundamentally fits in an ecosystem. Content creators don’t think in silos. Brands lives in Silos, content doesn’t. Also, consumers don’t live in silos, they live in a&amp;nbsp;natural and spontaneous ecosystem.”</news:description>

      <news:title>No medium can evolve without talking the native language: Sunil Kataria</news:title>
      <news:description>“No medium can actually evolve without talking and being distributed in the native language. Two large mediums in India - Print and TV - have grown on the back of regional content,” said Sunil Kataria CEO, India &amp;amp; SAARC, Godrej Consumer Products Limited, on Friday as part of his keynote address at the second edition of exchange4media's Content JAM. Kataria was addressing a room full of eager learners on the topic of ‘Rise of Regional Content to Realise Dream Digital India.’ &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536548710_4UV6Zj_content-jam.jpg" style="width:350px;height:193px;float:right"&gt;“Nearly 90 per cent of the print industry in India is regional. In the case of television, English channels contribute less than 4 per cent of the TV watch time. He demonstrated through data that the history of the two large mediums tells us that a medium has to speak the native tongue to really achieve scale.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Strangely though, digital alone has evolved through non-native language first and is now taking the regional route. “Nine out of 10 internet users who are online in India use indic languages. Regional content is driving consumption,” Kataria pointed out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of cheaper data costs, deeper penetration of feature phones and the easy access to internet, Kataria felt that&amp;nbsp;going regional on digital is crucial to the growth of the platform and brands on the platform. He shared insights on how brands can leverage digital for regional. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kataria said that the greatest insight about how people use regional language search is that people search for things online just like they talk about those things. “People do not search for ‘uttam bima’ online, they instead write ‘best insurance’ in their regional language in the search bar,” he pointed out. Therefore, he said that brands need to be prepared for conversation keywords or natural language search. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ad creatives tend to be made in one language with one generic creative or photograph, but that trend has to stop, Kataria said. “You cannot afford to have copy translations for regional content,” he said. “The days of a master Hindi copy or English copy getting a language edit are gone. We are in the time of creating ‘language masters’. Brands need to have multiple language masters.” He said that one way to create such regional content could be to work with local freelancers who are connected to the region they represent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the main insights that Kataria shared was that marketers could explore digital audio as the next big content domain. He pointed out that feature phones have greater penetration outside urban cities in India where smartphones are yet to be adopted. “Therefore, digital audio in regional language can take off much faster in India. And digital audio also works for urban and metro audiences who may use it as companion audio while walking, traveling, or working out.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kataria said that brands should choose content-led targeting for regional audiences. But with that comes the main challenges of making regional content sitting in Mumbai and Delhi. The other main challenge is that of measurement of digital in India. He said that while the industry is talking about the next big wave of digital and regional, we badly need a measurement tool like EKAM (proposed by BARC) to study and build on the trends.</news:description>

      <news:title>OOH industry welcomes new by-laws for public advertisements in Bengaluru</news:title>
      <news:description>Illegal hoardings and banners across&amp;nbsp;the country&amp;nbsp;are an eyesore&amp;nbsp;and Bangalore is (or was) no different. But things took a turn&amp;nbsp;after several complaints and petitions were&amp;nbsp;filed regarding this issue with the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the administrative body responsible for the civic and infrastructural assets of the Greater Bengaluru metropolitan area.&amp;nbsp;In August, the Karnataka High Court instructed the BBMP authorities to&amp;nbsp;immediately remove all illegal flex boards.&amp;nbsp;According to media reports, around 21,000 flex posters, hoardings and banners have been&amp;nbsp;removed from the city since then. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BBMP approves new advertising policy  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;To curb&amp;nbsp;illegal hoarding menace in the city, the BBMP council has approved a new draft advertising policy titled ‘BBMP Outdoor Signage and Public Messaging, 2018’ that calls for a ban on all illegal commercial billboards and hoardings in the city. The ban on illegal hoardings will not apply to advertising and branding on skywalks, public transit stations, bus queue shelters, or car-share and bike-sharing stations where firms have invested in advertising rights in advance. As per the new advertising policy,&amp;nbsp;Bengaluru city has been divided into four advertising zones namely A, B, C, and D. Zone A includes areas such as Rajbhavan Road, Palace Road, Cubbon Park, Ambedkar Veedhi, Kumara Krupa Road etc, where no hoardings (including neons) are permitted. The policy also outlines that&amp;nbsp;BBMP is the sole approving authority for all outdoor advertisement on private or public premises, building, property walls, roofs, parapets, and public structures such as, poles and lamp posts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOH industry welcomes move &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;OOH players feel that new advertising policy by BBMP is a step in the right direction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It is a good thing that BBMP has finally woken up to form a new advertising policy. They have been following a policy framed 50 years ago and it was never revised until now. It is important to keep the aesthetics of the city in mind if they want to make Bangalore an international standard city. There have been attempts in the past to revisit the policy, but to no avail. Let's hope they don't do that this time and the govt will go ahead and issue a notification,” said Arvind Kumar, Executive Director, Advertising Club, Bangalore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The enforcement of this policy will benefit&amp;nbsp;OOH players who are organised and provide for specific OOH/ DOOH platforms such as bus stations, railways, ticket counters, etc&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the new policy, Shriranga Sudhakara, Founder &amp;amp; Managing Director, Vyoma Media, said, “The new advertising policy by BBMP is a step in the right direction. Removing illegal hoardings and flexes across the city will create a positive impact on the city landscape and enhance the aesthetics of the city. The High Court of Karnataka and BBMP should be lauded for taking this bold step."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Once a clear, well thought out policy is in place, the next important step is the strict enforcement of the guidelines. BBMP has in the past allowed a mushrooming of illegal hoardings and this should not happen this time. Only with proper enforcement will confidence come from vendors to invest in high quality OOH/Digital OOH assets.The policy should incentivise vendors to transition to Digital OOH by giving a moratorium on paying the license fee for a few years etc. The capital cost of moving to Digital OOH is extremely high and unless BBMP takes a proactive stance, this transition will not happen. If you look at global cities of the world such as, New York, London, Hong Kong, Singapore and Sydney, the city authorities have created friendly policies towards Digital OOH assets and hence has made it viable for vendors to invest in high quality assets,” added Sudhakara. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As per Surendra Kumar, Director at MyHoardings.com, the advertisement policy recently formed is a welcome move which curbs the menace of the illegal hoardings widely prevalent across Bangalore, but, the non-clarity on issuance of new licenses and the failure to provide ample options to brands for their promotional activities, seem to have defeated the purpose.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“'More is not always better.&amp;nbsp;Blindly installing more OOH / DOOH assets only creates more clutter and law of diminishing utility comes into effect. The advertising and media agencies have realised the importance of quality over quantity. For instance, on MG Road, whether there are 200 billboards or 50 billboards, it will be the same eyeballs who will be looking at the billboards. Hence, providing aesthetically appealing designs that will make it pleasing for viewership is more important than having more assets which then will not attract any eyeballs and will be repulsive,” added Sudhakara. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“BBMP needs to realise this, and the same logic is true for their earnings also. Just by putting more displays it will not lead to more earnings and in this case ‘less is more’. As a Digital OOH company, we have experienced this first hand in the last 11 years of operations. For instance, we are present at the ticket counters, vis-a-vis point of transaction across 400+ railway and metro stations providing an invaluable utility to passengers, and on average each passenger’s dwell time is about 10 minutes. This allows brands to communicate their messages in an effective and meaningful manner. With the help of strategically placed digital displays at eye-level where 70 per cent of our displays feature branded content and the remaining 30 per cent show the passenger’s journey information, actually leads to more consumer engagement and visibility to brands, thereby enhancing ad spends and leading to higher earning for everyone in the ecosystem," said Sudhakara.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The need of of the hour is a transparent tender process (for identified fixed number of hoarding spaces on government property) and invitations of applications from private property owners (which can be reviewed and filtered) to have limited OOH advertisement spaces in Bangalore. This approach in amalgamation with the recently announced advertising policy can provide a ray of hope that the ‘Outdoor Advertising Industry’ has&amp;nbsp;been looking for since&amp;nbsp;long,” said Surendra Kumar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Penetration of DOOH is constantly on the rise in Indian cities such as Bangalore, and the current advertisement policy, if implemented correctly has the potential to increase the revenue for alternate advertisement mediums apart from flex hoardings (bus stations and railway platform advertisements),” added&amp;nbsp;Surendra Kumar.</news:description>

      <news:title>Content JAM: The production of originals doesn't come cheap: Sunil Lulla, Balaji Telefilms</news:title>
      <news:description>For a long time now, content creators have been preparing for content-on-the-go and for an audience that wants it now. How have newer forms of technology changed this conversation? At exchange4media's annual content-marketing conference - Content JAM, Sunil Lulla, Group CEO, Balaji Telefilms Ltd. spoke candidly to exchange4media’s Associate Editor, Naziya Alvi Rahman, about everything OTT and content-marketing, right from spilling the beans on ALTBalaji’s master-marketing to what branded content means to him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536548397_meHuEY_content-jam-logo.jpg" style="width:350px;height:193px;float:right"&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the heart of ALTBalaji’s content-marketing strategy, decoded Lulla is, “entertainment, entertainment and entertainment.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“You create something which is acceptable to the audience. If you put profit as an objective, you’ll never make it. Entertainment is at the heart of it all and profit is just a by-product of it. I believe that the purpose of content and creating it is audiences," opined Lulla.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lulla said he sees TV content reaching a level of maturity. “So is cinema. The OTT space is a reflection of how you create content for individual consumption. And there the focus is on a huge amount of subscription money.” He spoke about how Indians are not in a habit of paying for their content. “For 30 years, we have been watching cable at a very, very cheap price. It is now that people are learning that there is content that I can get only if I pay. The market number which would be within 2 billion needs to go to triple digit,” said the CEO. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He explained that for him content is very personal. “Content viewing at home is very ambient. You may be watching it with a friend or by yourself, you may download it and watch it. A movie you may watch on an OTT platform but it is a catch-up. For OTT content, my focus is on what is original created for the OTT space.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the OTT originals, he exclaimed, “Content has always been original. So the buzz has been as continuous as the content created. We have created the most original content in the past one year. And it doesn’t come cheap. This is not about money. It is about engagement, entertainment and empowerment. It takes passion and it takes cash. If you spend good cash behind a good plot and good story, the same cash comes back to you.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lulla shared that to the brand while the larger reminder medium is print and outdoor is good to try and convert people, digital targeting remains an imperative part of the brand’s strategy. “How do consumers get to know about us? It is because we targeted them in the right fashion. By putting a hoarding out there, I’m not necessarily going to attract their attention. You start by catching these people in social and digital environments. Then you use the audio-visual content. And then it goes on to the reminder medium. While television is good to convert people through the habit who have not seen the content, the digital space allows you to look for people who are looking for that very content and target them,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When commenting on branded content and ads, he said, “I prefer not to do branding on the content. On occasions, when we have done ads, it’s not about money but about what the marketer can drive to the marketing objective. A content creator is there to sell the idea and not the product,” contended Lulla. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharing a content-marketing case-study of another brand that he likes he said, "I like James Bond the best because I think it started with two brands actually and now has a portfolio of nine brands and you still don’t believe that it’s overwhelming.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We don’t see content-marketing as something merely to get a return out of. We see it as serving a larger objective which is to get people engaged, entertained and empowered," he continued. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asserting on whether the term ‘content marketing’ need to be streamlined or redefined, Lulla said, “When content is created and if it’s created for the right kind of audience, you will market the content to the right kind of audience. The definition of it should be on the way you want to market it." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advising on content for the OTT space, Lulla said that industry players are all evolving and learning about what people would actually like to see. "If you’re a responsible player, you won’t stretch the limit of people’s fantasies and will still play within the context of the usually acceptable. Let’s not get excited by a kiss or show of skin, it’s not really relevant. In television, you kind of neuter the stories. For the OTT space you can stretch it beyond as it is an evolving market but know the differences."</news:description>

      <news:title>Content affects consumers depending on the mindset they are in: Zirca Digital</news:title>
      <news:description>The market is getting increasingly cluttered and there is an overload of brand content today. This relentless stream of content is making it harder for brands to cut through the noise and stand out. With so many distractions surrounding consumers, how can a marketer earn their attention? &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536548397_meHuEY_content-jam-logo.jpg" style="width:350px;height:193px;float:right"&gt;&lt;br&gt;The question was answered by Zirca Digital’s Managing Director Karan Kumar Gupta and Strategy Head Sidharth Gowda as the two took to the stage to speak on 'linking content with mindset' during Content Jam, the annual content marketing conference hosted by exchange4media, in Mumbai on Friday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gupta started the session saying, “Content is the king. It is the buzzword today. And brands have taken that into consideration.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Brands understand that it is much easier for them to have a communication with people rather than just pushing ads on their faces and have them accept it,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But content needs to be looked at from the point of view of the consumer’s mindset, said Gupta. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Content affects consumers depending on the mindset they are in, their personality type and the way they consume the different type of content available in the market.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gowda echoed Gupta’s thought. “We often talk about targeting the right consumer, with the right message and at the right place. But if you really want to target the audience, it is interesting to target them according to their mindset-- as per the stage of life they are in and what’s on the top of their mind at any given point of time.” said Gowda. For example, the mindset of a 33-year-old first-time father will be different from a 33-yaer-old single traveller. So targeting them the same way just on the basis of their age may not really help, explained Gowda.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gowda went on to say that marketers often talk about creating content that is inspiring, but the important question is: What makes a content inspiring? He answered, saying content could be made inspiring and interesting by using great stories of human connect or by using technology to make simple content interesting. Or it could be both - technology enabling great stories of human connect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gowda believes that content cannot be defined clearly. “Content lives in a grey area. We all create content. It covers everything—from advertising to e-mailers to video content. And so it is ok to not be able to define content clearly.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Going further, he said marketers also need to question who their real competitors are. “We often think that we are operating in a category. But the fact is that brands of different categories are targeting the same person,” he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For example, a well earning single millennial living alone in a city will be at any given time targeted by not just different brands in a category but by brands operating in different categories as well. There could be a car company, a shoe company or a restaurant - all vying for his attention at the same time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In such a scenario, what are the chances of your brand’s content standing out in the whole noise that is happening around this consumer? What are chances of your content standing out in the culture and making an impact on the life of the consumer? So the real question to ask is: who is our cultural competitor as opposed to our immediate competitor? Because the consumer is not buying your product in silos,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, concluding the session, Gowda explained how some brands also target consumers on the basis of their personality type.</news:description>

      <news:title>People want to be entertained, not watch ads: Sujit Ganguli, ICICI Bank</news:title>
      <news:description>Sujit Ganguli, Head of Brand &amp;amp; Communication at ICICI Bank, believes that the job of a marketer is to bring alive all the cold hard facts of the business and make them interesting for the consumers. And the need to make the communication interesting for the consumers has become even more important in the context of the highly competitive environment in which marketers currently operate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking at exchange4media’s Content Jam conference in Mumbai on Friday, Ganguli spoke about ‘crafting content for business outcomes’. Exploring the topic, the communication veteran outlined the challenges which content marketers face today and suggested strategies to overcome these challenges. Using campaigns created by ICICI Bank as cases studies, Ganguli showed how good content can result in great business outcomes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536546341_0l6ltX_content-jam-logo.jpg" style="width:350px;height:193px;float:right"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the challenges, Ganguli said viewers today have no dearth of options to watch content and so marketers need to create communications that can break the clutter and stand out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“As marketers, when we are pushing out content to people, we need to realise that the other content that our consumers are seeing are on rich platforms. Also, a lot of the content today is video. Consumers are seeing serials, movies and sport on demand; they can choose what they want to see. Even on social media platforms, the content is customised. They get to see what they like… food, travel, sports or anything else.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“And so this is the context in which we advertisers will have to craft our content which stands out and bring results for us. People want to be entertained, not watch ads,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another challenge for marketers, Ganguli feels, is to communicate the core message in a short span of time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“On a digital or social media platform, if you are not able to catch consumers’ attention in less than 2 or 3 seconds, you have lost the consumer. It takes less than a second for a viewer to flip the feed and go to the next content on his mobile phone. Also, it is very important to create content that can be shared. Because ultimately that is earned content,” said Ganguli.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Going further, Ganguli stressed that the market still operates on the basic principles that were taught to him in his business school 20-25 years ago. According to him, the techniques may have changed but the principles have not changed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The basic principles of marketing that we have learnt 20-25 years ago in business schools have not changed. May be the technique has changed, but the principles have not changed. The formats or tricks may have changed, but the principles of doing for the audience, getting insights, reaching out to the rights audience have not changed, and will not change in the near future,” said Ganguli.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharing examples of how interesting communication content can give a boost to business, Ganguli showed audience campaigns created for three products of ICICI Bank-- 20% extra home loan plan, Ferrari credit cards and CSR initiative ‘Gift of livelihood’. All these campaigns got millions of ‘views’ and ‘shares’ on digital platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These campaigns were very successful and a lot of it happened because of shareability, said Ganguly, adding, “If the content is good, people will share it. Because of virality, we were able to get reach and we were able to get our message across.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Finally, concluding the session, Ganguli highlighted five points for every marketer to remember:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;• Target your core audience&lt;br&gt;• Get the insight right&lt;br&gt;• Keep the creative interesting&lt;br&gt;• Have prominent call to action&lt;br&gt;• Keep experimenting&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Keep doing new things. Only that can entail success,” he signed off.</news:description>

      <news:title>Content Jam 2018: Content is currency for a brand: MD, Perfetti Van Melle India </news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536545355_JUdkW2_contentjaminside.jpg" style="width:350px;height:193px;float:right"&gt;If the consumer can be engaged beyond eight-seconds then half of the battle has been won for marketers. The key task here then is how marketers can make content interesting enough to hold viewer attention for a longer duration. For Rajesh Ramakrishnan, MD, Perfetti Van Melle India, that’s where content marketing comes into play as he engaged the audience in his session on ‘Content Matters: Ignore at your own Peril’ at e4m Content Jam, part of Indian Content Marketing Awards 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ramakrishnan said, “Content marketing is hitting the sweet spot between what brands want to say and what consumers are looking for. Either way, how do we deliver the brand promise in a meaningful and relevant manner to the consumer such that it meets their needs?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the MD, content is like a ‘currency’ for a brand. It (brand) can give something valuable to the consumer in the form of engagement, education, entertainment and inspiration. “In return brands can get loyalty, trust, respect, word of mouth and love. That’s what content can do. It can be the pivotal place between adding value from brands to consumers and in turn getting something back from consumers.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He gave a few instances on how brands such as Dove came up with multiple pieces of work to redefine beauty. Especially in ‘Dove Real Beauty Sketches’ it gets consumers to rethink and re-evaluate set notions. For engagement, he referred to Netflix, on how the OTT service has a strong understanding of consumer data and uses it effectively to anticipate customer need. “For instance for ‘House of Cards’ there were 10 different trailer cuts. Depending on the browsing behaviour and viewing habits, relevant trailers were fed to customers.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Visibly impressed with how Netflix closed the loop, Ramakrishnan added, “By giving consumers GIFs and other shareable items, it created word of mouth and vitality."He mentioned other examples where a brand like Samsung did a great job of seamlessly weaving content to cut-through creatives without being intrusive. &lt;br&gt;For entertainment Ramakrishnan picked up The Viral Fever’s third original series ‘Tripling’ in association with Tata Motors’ Tiago where the role of the car (Tiago) evolved and played an instrumental role. “Clearly there was an impact in tangible things in terms of sales and market share. Obviously it’s not the only reason, but it does play a big role in the overall scheme of things.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to inspiration, he talked about Redbull, a company which has always pushed the envelope with regard to content marketing. Most of the times it’s actually out of the company’s comfort zone as mentioned by the MD. Ramakrishnan chose the Red Bull Stratos project where Austrian skydiver Felix Baumgartner jumped nearly 96,000 feat from the stratosphere, landing unharmed in New Mexico Desert and simultaneously creating a record. "Red Bull are right up there with the kind of stuff that they do. By showing some of the stunts, they get consumers to push boundaries and create more experiences," he said.&lt;br&gt;And that, at the end of the day, should be the endeavour of content marketing.</news:description>

      <news:title>Social Media is a shot in the arm for traditional media: Zeinab Badawi, BBC World News</news:title>
      <news:description>Global Questions, BBC's international television and radio debate programme, gives local audiences around the world a unique chance to put their questions to a high-profile panel of leaders and opinion formers. The programme travelled to New Delhi for the first time to assess India after nearly 70 years of its independence. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Presenter Zeinab Badawi, an international award winning journalist and presenter of BBC World News’ flagship interview programme, HARDtalk, was in New Delhi to host the chapter of Global Questions. She spoke with exchange4media about India becoming superpower and the role of media in post truth political era among other things.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jkjCAVv1CD4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are your expectations from the Global Questions - India that you will be hosting this week?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I think that we cannot, as an organisation, ignore India which is why Global Questions is here. India is one of the pivotal nations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot of developing countries look to India to see how it has transformed the economy. It is technologically driven in many ways and is the world’s biggest democracy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the general elections looming next year we thought it was the right moment to come to India to explore what is going on in the people’s minds. The question we are posing is, ‘Is India the world’s next super power?'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can traditional media play any role in reducing the impact of fake news being spread using social media?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it first came around, the traditional media was a bit perplexed if social media was a threat to them. However, it has been a shot in the arm for traditional media like the BBC.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a world where everyone has an opinion and comment is free, the traditional media, be it the print or broadcast, say ‘look comment is free but fact is sacred’ and what we do is facts. We (traditional media) give unbiased presentation of news. We are not slanting the news the way one sees on social media where you have fiction sometimes masquerading as truth. I think it actually shows how much we need these trusted and tested organisation and yes, traditional media uses social media now as a way of disseminating its message. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Politicians extensively use social media to communicate with people. Do you think the role of press is being suppressed because of it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is nothing wrong with political leaders using social media for communicating with voters and citizens at large but it doesn’t mean that they should ignore the traditional media. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problem with social media is that is usually a one way communication...and I think one of the disadvantages of social media is this that politicians use it to communicate their message but not as a means of dialogue where as in an interview, like my show HARDtalks, in traditional media you can.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your message for Indian media?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Indian media is wonderful and I think the use of language and the kind of variety of voices India has, I think it should cherish it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Like you know a free media is cornerstone of any democracy and India being the world’s largest democracy so any threats to a free and transparent media here would be a matter of huge regret. I would say keep on battling for your right to Article 17 of universal declaration of human rights, free flow of information and freedom of expression is absolutely important and if you feel in any way that it is being compromised then you will have to stand up an raise your voice and say that you will not accept. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You have to be together regardless of the political persuasion. This goes beyond party politics. This is a fundamental human right that every country should have which is the freedom of expression.</news:description>

  nearly every brand went into overdrive. By early afternoon, Twitter was flooded &#13;
  with posts from brands supporting the judgment and flaunting all the colours &#13;
  of the rainbow. Some brands simply changed their logo to show support, others &#13;
  cracked a witty line or posted a meme, while some others even promoted their &#13;
  GIFs on platforms such as Instagram. &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  In a span of 24 hours, every brand that took its digital presence seriously &#13;
  welcomed the judgment. Brands that had until September 6 steered clear of LGBTQ &#13;
  topics or even avoided challenging status quo caught on to the trending hashtag &#13;
  for the day, just like they do for Mother’s Day, Earth Day or Independence Day. &#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  Brands have largely avoided associating with the LGBTQ cause, because it is &#13;
  a challenging topic and has to be executed with sensitivity. Some brands such &#13;
  as, Vicks and Brooke Bond Red Label Tea have addressed the discrimination against &#13;
  the transgender community in India. A few brands such as eBay, Anouk, Urban &#13;
  Clap, and Vodafone have portrayed gay and lesbian relationships in their ads. &#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  Burzin Mehta, Group Creative Director and Digital Creative Lead, Ogilvy, Mumbai, &#13;
  who recently created a campaign for the NGO Love Matters, tackling homophobia, &#13;
  said “Working on the LforLove campaign made me realise how challenging it is &#13;
  to portray the LGBTQ community in marketing communication.” He further added, &#13;
  “While it is wonderful for brands to stand behind a landmark verdict, in this &#13;
  case brands have used it as a way to ride a popular wave.” &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  Most brands that showed their support for the cause created witty one-liners. &#13;
  Very few chose to truly embrace the LGBTQ community and assure equal opportunities &#13;
  at the workplace or even protect the rights of the community. Parmesh Shahani, &#13;
  Head - Godrej IndiaCultureLab, and an LGBTQ activist tweeted: And for all the &#13;
  brands coming up with cool rainbow Instagram campaigns, please look and see &#13;
  if your HR policies are inclusive at first. Do you have non discrimination, &#13;
  partnership benefits and are you creating an internal culture?&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&#13;
  &lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If not, then all your rainbow themed “memes” that you &#13;
    hopefully want to “go viral” with are inauthentic and the queer community &#13;
    sees it as that. This &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Section377Verdict?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Section377Verdict&lt;/a&gt; &#13;
    gives you an opportunity to truly reflect, and engage meaningfully. Use it &#13;
    well.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

  One of India’s most respected companies, Tata Group was one of the few companies &#13;
  that did more than adopt the rainbow colours. The company tweeted: We have always &#13;
  provided equal opportunities for employment at Tata, irrespective of race, caste, &#13;
  gender, religion or sexual orientation. The tweet might not have gone viral, &#13;
  but it indicated that the company wasn’t simply being opportunistic and leveraging &#13;
  a trending topic.&lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&#13;
  &lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We welcome the landmark judgement by the Supreme Court &#13;

  &lt;!-- ELRTE_SCRIPT:script7419254893584142 --&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  The reason brands had never taken up the LGBTQ cause is because brands in India &#13;
  tend to play it safe, or impose self-censorship, say brand experts. “Legalising &#13;
  gay sex finally gave brands the freedom to talk about the issue without worrying &#13;
  about consequences. Brands may have wanted to talk about it earlier, but couldn’t &#13;
  because it was a controversial topic. Don’t look at brands as hypocrites because &#13;
  they are taking a stand only now,” said Rohit Raj, Co-founder and Chief Creative &#13;
  Officer, The Glitch. &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  Brands that have merely been associated with a celebrity who had an unpopular &#13;
  point of view have been forced to cut ties in the celebrity in the past. In &#13;
  April 2018, consumers threatened to boycott Amazon for associating with actor &#13;
  Swara Bhaskar who was protesting against alleged obstruction of justice in the &#13;
  Kathua and Unnao rape cases. Amazon India distanced itself from the celebrity &#13;
  endorser by deleting a tweet that featured her. In 2015, facing rising app uninstalls, &#13;
  Snapdeal did not renew its contract with brand ambassador Aamir Khan who spoke &#13;
  about ‘rising intolerance in India.’ &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  This is in contrast to what iconic brand Nike did for its 30-year anniversary. &#13;
  The brand took a stand on the Black Lives Matter movement by featuring American &#13;
  footballer Colin Kaepernick in its ads. The ad has divided the nation but has &#13;
  strongly resonated with the black community in the US. Nike’s politically charged &#13;
  stand as much an endorsement of the movement as it is a smart marketing campaign. &#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  The brand has historically challenged the status quo. In 1995, Nike asked consumers &#13;
  to let girls play, and in 2017, the brand designed a hijab for fencer Ibtihaj &#13;
  Muhammad and Muslim sportswomen everywhere. The brand has taken largely unpopular &#13;
  stands, and with every such campaign, expanded its market and affinity among &#13;
  consumers. &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  Rohit said that Nike’s ad is a genius move but a super-calculated one at that. &#13;
  “They have got the attention of the entire Black community in the US by supporting &#13;
  the Black Lives Matter movement. Very few brands are bold enough to go ahead &#13;
  and take a stand of that kind,” he added. &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  Another brand, Dove, has been empowering women through its ads and digital content &#13;
  for many years now. Dove’s social experiment campaign - Real Beauty - defines &#13;
  the brand and what it stands for in earnest. With campaigns like these Dove &#13;
  and Nike have earned more than just a few likes and shares through their commodity-activism. &#13;
  The Tata Group on the other hand solidified its image as a brand that stands &#13;
  for diversity. &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  That is because each of these brands appear to be more credible than a brand &#13;
  that simply creates a topical post. “If it is a few retweets, likes or the such &#13;
  is what you are after, it is okay to have a quick witty take on what's trending. &#13;
  But if it is affinity or preference that you are after, then you need to be &#13;
  credible, not just current. Speaking up for an issue is different from talking &#13;
  about it. And in an environment where causes are the clutter, one sure way to &#13;
  break it is to do something that makes a difference,” cautions Arvind Krishnan, &#13;
  MD, BBH India. &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  It does not suffice to celebrate a landmark judgment like the decriminalisation &#13;
  of gay sex with a meme and forget the cause until the next it trends again. &#13;
  “I sincerely hope that the brands that celebrated the verdict by putting out &#13;
  a topical Facebook post, go beyond doing just that. If you'd like to take a &#13;
  stand, then it helps to do it like you mean it,” said Mehta. &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  Navin Talreja, Founder, The Womb, identifies the root of the meme-led support &#13;
  of brands to a cluttered media environment. “With increased noise, fragmentation &#13;
  and clutter, brands need to borrow and ride on what is happening in popular &#13;
  culture and society to become a part of conversations. Burger King and Nike &#13;
  are examples of brands that do this very well.” &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br&gt;&#13;
  He too felt that credibility and authenticity are at the core of getting it &#13;
  right. “I think that's the new model of communication, and if done well, can &#13;
  add immense value to brands. Even if brands have never attached themselves to &#13;
  certain aspects of society (eg: LGBT), it is absolutely okay for them to choose &#13;
  to do so now. The only word of caution would be that somewhere the latching &#13;
  on or riding on such things need to be credible as far as the core of the brand &#13;
  is concerned and not do so just for the sake of it. Done without leveraging &#13;
  the core may not backfire but will also add no value and will seem superficial &#13;
  and fake to modern consumers,” Talreja said. &lt;/p&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>YouTube Originals taps into the journey of creators for first India show</news:title>
      <news:description>YouTube Originals is all set to launch in India in three weeks, with an innovative variation on the music reality show genre. The show titled ARRived - “an authentic search for the best music talent in India with A.R. Rahman” - will be available for free on YouTube in India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YouTube, the primary destination for video content creators, has been an integral part of the journey to recognition and fame for many talented people. YouTube offers a democratic platform where people can showcase their talent and become stars in their own right. In 2014, YouTube had 16 channels with more than 1 million subscribers in India. Satya Raghavan, Entertainment Head, YouTube in&amp;nbsp;India, said that this number has now grown to over 300 channels and “we’re adding two more almost every single week,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;User-generated content has been the cornerstone of YouTube. “The show AARived is born from the insight that many people are taking their first step into trying to eke out a career in the space of music on YouTube. It was very important to recognise that and celebrate that journey of creators. Our objective is to help the people who are starting out their journey,” Raghavan said.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536551348_SFldrE_Youtube-box-02.jpg" style="width:279px;height:494px"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ad-supported Model&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Globally, YouTube Originals is part of the video-streaming platform’s subscription driven YouTube Premium service. In the introductory stage “YouTube Originals is going to be ad-supported and not subscription driven,” said Raghavan. A study by KPMG on the media and entertainment sector shows that the OTT space in India is primarily driven by the AVOD or Freemium model. Is the Indian market not ready for an SVOD model yet? “Not at all! YouTube Premium available in 17 countries and there is a roadmap for launching it in many other countries. I am sure at some point of time it will happen in India as well,” said Raghavan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite brand safety concerns on YouTube, the video streaming platform is the primary destination for advertisers looking for mass reach. According to a KPMG Report titled Media Ecosystems: The Walls Fall Down, CPMs for OTT platforms are declining on account of an increase in the base of viewers. Currently OTT platforms such as Hotstar and SonyLiv are known to charge a premium that is around 1.2-1.5 times that of YouTube. For all these reasons, brands continue to invest in YouTube for digital video advertising.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We have been seeing many brands come forward to work with creators in the past. Our goal is to further boost the ecosystem and supercharge the growth,” Raghavan said. YouTube tested the waters in India with two sponsored shows as pilots. These shows were centered around cricket and were hosted by Gaurav Kapur and Vikram Sathaye. “We are working closely with advertisers to test the market and the results have been phenomenal,” Raghavan added. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mothership of Content &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;YouTube has been receiving pitches from content creators across platforms and formats. “We have received some amazing ideas from film creators, traditional media partners, and folks with whom we have not worked in the past,” revealed Raghavan. He said that content creators who work on YouTube Originals can expect to grow their community and followers because of an expansion of their audience due to the marketing efforts that will go into promoting the shows. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While comedy and thrillers seem to be a very popular genre for Original content coming out of India, YouTube is kicking off with Music. Raghavan said that YouTube, which is the mothership of all content, will dabble in all genres and formats of content with Originals in India. For now YouTube is launching only one Original show in India while globally, YouTube Originals has released over 60 projects so far, and plans to release more than 50 new shows in 2019. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;YouTube will draw insights from the kind of content Indian users prefer and accordingly commission shows. “We have the good fortune of having some amazing insights and data on how each of the verticals such as movies, comedy and music behave. So we are learning from YouTube and figuring out which are the things we can go after,” he said.  &lt;/div&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Reliance General Insurance's #FaceThePace urges little pillion riders to wear helmet </news:title>
      <news:description>Reliance General Insurance Company Limited, a 100% subsidiary of Reliance Capital, has launched a digital campaign to raise public awareness on the safety of pillion riders on two-wheelers. Titled #FaceThePace, the campaign urges that children riding pillion on two-wheelers be made to wear helmet when on the road.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/44jYxBr2E9I?rel=0&amp;wmode=transparent" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As per estimates, nearly 16,000 children die in road accidents every year, making 10.5% of all road accident fatalities. This boils down to over 43 child deaths a day due to road accidents, a number that is 7 times more than deaths due to crimes against children.&lt;br&gt;In a bid to raise awareness on the problem, the Company’s campaign highlights the consequences of pillion riders not wearing a helmet. Even though stricter laws and initiatives in the last few years have increased the number of two-wheeler drivers wearing a helmet, the number of pillion riders not wearing a helmet is still staggeringly high, at 75%, as reported by nationwide surveys.&amp;nbsp;To address the issue, traffic police in various states of the country have been taking measures such as stricter monitoring and increased number of challans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through #FaceThePace the Company is taking to popular digital and social media channels to share its message. At the center of the digital campaign is a short film that uses the analogy of a batsman and wicket-keeper on a cricket field to deliver the message.&lt;br&gt;Sharing his thoughts on the initiative, Rakesh Jain, Chief Executive Officer, Reliance General Insurance, said, “India loses thousands of lives to road accidents every year. We think it is vital to address this issue in a way that has not been done before. And we believe this film does exactly that. The cricket analogy in the film is something most Indians will relate to, owing to the popularity of the game in the country.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the digital campaign, RGI is also distributing thousands of free helmets to riders around the country. The company has launched several initiatives for road safety in the past and intends to continue raising awareness on such issues of grave social concern.</news:description>

      <news:title>Times Fresh Face joins hands with Livon to launch its 11th season </news:title>
      <news:description>The Times of India has brought on board Livon to partner for the 11th season of its flagship talent-hunt platform - Livon Times Fresh Face powered by Set Wet. Since a decade, the hunt has been the national platform that brings together young and talented collegians from all over the country. Last year, the contest introduced the concept of ‘What’s your Fresh Factor?’, wherein the participants go beyond exhibiting their personalities to demonstrate their talent in unconventional ways. In continuation, this season will focus on both talent and personality while the search will be more rigorous and advanced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Entering the next decade of the property, there is a twist in the launch of this edition, Bollywood personalities, Nushrat Bharucha and Amit Sadh will be flagging off the contest via a Facebook Premiere with anchor Sanket Bhosale. Apart from discussing their own fresh factor, they will also be opening up about their life and creative journeys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the contest, Sanjeev Bhargava, Director of Brand TOI, said, “The Times of India is not only a chronicler of change but an enabler of positive change. We attempt to impact positive change in many different ways through initiatives that empower the citizens of this country to impact the environment, the health issues facing the country, improving the economic and political awareness in the country. One of the key areas we have identified is to empower the upcoming generations of Indians with self-confidence and recognition, opening the doors to new opportunities for them. Livon Times Fresh Face is one such initiative. We believe that by reaching out to ambitious and talented youth in colleges around the country, and encouraging them to recognize and showcase the power of their talent and personalities, we are not only giving these bright future stars a big platform but also inspiring thousands of other fellow students through our events and amplification in media. The change their talent can bring about is what will contribute to defining the future of this country.’’&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actress Nushrat Bharucha said, “Having seen the talent garnered in the previous years, I have to say I am amazed at how gifted the youth of the country is. I am so honoured to be part of the Livon Times Fresh Face and I am confident we will be seeing a lot of extraordinary talent this year. If you think you have the personality and talent that will wow the world, this is definitely where you should head to.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actor Amit Sadh said, “I have always held that talent and determination will help you scale the heights you want to reach. I know for a fact that our country is full of young and talented individuals and it is very heartening to see them get the platform and recognition they deserve with Livon Times Fresh Face. I’m very glad to be part of this initiative and I cannot wait to see what this edition has in store.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Garnering over 1 million social media followers and over 1 lakh participants till date, the past editions have wowed the audience and created a stronger connect thereby creating a rather large talent-hunt platform in India. Celebrities Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan, Siddharth Malhotra, Sonakshi Sinha, Ayushmann Khurrana, Neha Kakkar and Yami Gautam shared stories about their Fresh Factors in the previous editions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year the hunt will stretch over 180 college auditions and open mall auditions across 11 cities- Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune, Chandigarh, Nagpur, Chennai, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Indore. The talent-hunt is targeted at college students in the age group 16-22. Interested participants can apply via the Livon Times Fresh Face Season 11 website. The competition will be spread across several rounds of auditions, starting with the college auditions followed by open mall auditions, leading participants will then compete at the semi-finale from where the winners will move to the city finales; city winners will then go on to compete at the Grand Finale, which will be held in Mumbai. The most talented male and female participants with the Fresh Factor will be crowned Livon Times Fresh Face 2018.</news:description>

      <news:title>There will be more than 500 million online video audience by 2020: Kranti Gada, Shemaroo</news:title>
      <news:description>At the recent&amp;nbsp;edition of exchange4media’s content marketing conference Content Jam, Shemaroo Entertainment COO Kranti Gada shared her thoughts on content creation and building brands for the masses on the digital platform. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, content creation is driven by targeted opportunities. So is there a way for brands to achieve a large scale on digital? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To answer the question, Gada started off by saying, “All these years, when we spoke about content and digital platforms, we spoke about targeting audience and how digital audience looks differently. But as digital becomes mass, which will happen for sure, it will ape broader mediums, mainly television.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about what Shemaroo stands for, Gada said, “Few months back, we carried out an exercise to find out how we can re-position ourselves in this new world of content, what is going to be relevant to India in the&amp;nbsp;long run and what do we stand for? We found that we really stand for and wanted to be unabashedly Indian, delivering masala and over-the-top content,” said Gada.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Shemaroo wanted to be an antidote to boredom and stress for billions of Indians by delivering high quality content that appeals to the initial palate and is accessible on demand,” said the COO. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gada further shared that unlike the popular belief, 97 per cent of millennials do not live in tier I cities. “There are more than 450 million millennials in tier II and tier III cities.  By 2021, rural internet consumers are expected to grow from 38 per cent to 52 per cent. Eventually, of the 829 million internet users, just 129 million are expected to be from metros,” she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She further said, “Online video audience will double from 250 million in 2017 to more than 500 million by&amp;nbsp;2020. The digital sector is poised to witness the entrance of first-time internet users, especially from smaller towns and rural areas.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about their property Shemaroo Filmi Gane, which has 14 million subscribers, more than 60 per cent of whom are millennials, Gada said, “It has more than 78 million unique monthly viewers and is ranked No. 1 retro music channel in India. Also, it has 16 billion-plus watch time (in mins).”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the type and language of content that will be offered in the future, Gada said, “Only 7 per cent of the time spent on videos is in English language in India. In the next five years, 75 per cent of the new internet users are expected to consume content in local languages,” she said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gada mentioned that regional and devotional content also has quite a high demand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;“There are 100 million-plus average monthly views on Shemaroo’s regional YouTube channels,” informed Gada. &lt;br&gt;About devotional content, she said, “Shemaroo has been a fundamental player in the devotional content category for over a decade. We produce, aggregate and distribute content catering to diverse religious beliefs, including Hinduism, Sikhism and Islam. There are 3 million-plus subscribers on YouTube for Shemaroo’s devotional content.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gada said that Shemaroo identifies trends and offers content that people want.&lt;br&gt;“We are experts in identifying trends and curating content which is loved and enjoyed by Indians,” she concluded.  &lt;/div&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Vivo strengthens its portfolio in India with the launch of the V11 Pro</news:title>
      <news:description>Vivo, the global premium smartphone brand, today unveiled the V11 Pro, a smartphone that sets new industry benchmarks with its In-Display Fingerprint Technology, new Halo FullView™ Display and AI powered dual pixel sensor camera. The V11 Pro is the first in the V series to incorporate In-Display Fingerprint Scanning Technology, continuing Vivo’s technology leadership in biometric security, while maintaining a sleek and stylish design. Vivo’s V11 Pro also features key design breakthroughs, with the new Halo FullView™ Display paired with Starry Night and Dazzling Gold colors, all enclosed within a curved 3D body to provide a seamless and immersive user experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a commitment to the ‘Make in India’ program, V11 Pro has been manufactured at Vivo’s Greater Noida facility.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Vivo’s focus and commitment is to bring the best intuitive and personal mobile experience for consumers across the board,” said Kent Cheng, CEO, Vivo India. “The V series has been a torchbearer of innovation for Vivo. If you were to glance through the timeline of the V series – from the V1 launched in 2015 to the V11 Pro launched today – you will find a trend of constant innovation. The all new V11 Pro incorporates never seen before cutting-edge features that redefine the way the world perceives Vivo devices. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By providing an In-Display fingerprint scanner, AI powered dual pixel sensor camera running on the Snapdragon 660AIE processor, the V11 Pro lets consumers do more every day.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V11 Pro’s AI Camera Creates Perfect Photos with Ease&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The V11 Pro continues Vivo’s pursuit of the perfect shot. Following the success of the V9 earlier this year, Vivo has stepped up its development of AI to answer consumer’s demand for more powerful photography features that adapt to any scenario.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;V11 Pro features a 12MP + 5MP dual rear camera combination with a large f/1.8 aperture and 1.28μm pixels, as well as a 25MP front camera. The 12MP rear camera boasts Dual Pixel Sensors with 24 million photosensitive units for higher light sensitivity and DSLR-standard Dual-Pixel Autofocus technology that can lock focus in just 0.03 seconds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking perfect photos has never been easier with these groundbreaking features that address typical photography challenges and instantly turns amateurs into near-professional photographers. V11 Pro’s AI Backlight HDR and AI Low Light Mode use AI algorithms to capture multiple frames for greater detail, and combine them to create perfectly exposed photos, even for difficult lighting environments such as sunsets. Adding to the list of AI photography features is AI Scene Recognition, which identifies different objects, elements and scenes, and applies specially customized enhancements to make your photos really “pop”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For perfect selfies anywhere anytime, V11 Pro introduces all-new AI Face Shaping technology, with an AI face-modelling algorithm that adds individual treatments to your facial features, creating beautiful yet natural selfies. The improved AI Selfie Lighting feature also offers more lighting effects with AI algorithms that understand how the user’s face interacts three-dimensionally with light. On top of that, AI Portrait Framing makes framing the perfect shot easier than ever, by using artificial intelligence to guide users. It prompts users on how to hold the phone in the optimal position, effortlessly producing perfectly framed portrait shots every time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smarter Experience, More Powerful Performance&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beyond photography, the V11 Pro expands the AI mobile experience across the board with Vivo’s AI assistant Jovi, with features like Jovi Smart Scene, Google Lens and Google Assistant. Jovi Smart Scene makes everyday life easier by recognizing user scenarios and acting accordingly, including checking the weather and providing real time information. Google Assistant helps with everyday situations like map navigation, online shopping, travel arrangements, music, video and even social media, while Google Lens, backed by advanced deep-learning algorithms, lets users search for what they see.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Supporting these incredible AI features, V11 Pro is powered by the Snapdragon 660AIE processor with 6GB RAM + 64GB ROM (expandable), ensuring ultra-smooth performance. The latest Funtouch OS 4.5 (based on Android 8.1) and Vivo’s Jovi AI Engine work together to also allocate CPU and memory resources efficiently to handle multiple complex operations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Futuristic Immersive Design with the V series’ first In-Display Fingerprint Scanning Technology&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The V11 Pro features a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, 16.28cm Super AMOLED Halo FullView™ Display with a 91.27% screen-to-body ratio. The ultra-thin 1.76mm side bezels, paired with the 3D curved body design blends the edges of the phone into the display, creating an immersive viewing experience that fits perfectly in your hand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;V11 Pro is the first model in the V series to incorporate In-Display Fingerprint Scanning Technology, which eliminates visible fingerprint pad to create a seamless design from front to back. The technology first made its debut in CES earlier this year and has effectively created bigger screens without compromising on security options. Incorporating this cutting-edge technology in V11 Pro is the latest testament to Vivo’s efforts to solve consumer pain points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The accuracy of Face Access has also been enhanced using infrared light, which accurately scans 1,024 facial feature points to unlock instantly, even in the dark.</news:description>

      <news:title> Video, vernacular and newer advertising formats the way ahead: Experts at ICMA 2018</news:title>
      <news:description>With the explosion of competing on-demand and OTT service providers, we now live in a world where the ‘anytime, anywhere, any device’ concept reigns supreme. As the OTT and on-demand market becomes more saturated than ever before, each provider must&amp;nbsp;stand out among&amp;nbsp;competition. So what does it really take to create a sustainable content play?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;At the Audacity exchange4media Indian Content Marketing Awards 2018 (ICMA) and recent edition of Content JAM, a panel comprising Arnab Mitra, Managing Director, Liqvd Asia Worldwide, Manish Aggarwal, Business Head, Zee5 India, Akash Banerji, Head, Marketing and Partnerships, Viacom 18 Digital Ventures, Voot and Neha Warrier, VP Sales India, Mirriad, reflected on this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mitra chaired the session and spoke about how the industry continues to be contradictory. “On one side we have not just Indian but international players such as&amp;nbsp;Netflix and Amazons of the world investing a lot of money in creating content. On the other side, we have free-to-air television channels, which are continuing to connect to the deeper parts of the society,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aggarwal said that thanks to smartphone penetration and low-data cost, the consumer’s appetite is growing. “The Indian consumer is hungry for good content and especially if it’s in the language of their choice. The interest is driven by the fact that he has the appetite to be spending approx 8 gigabytes of data on the&amp;nbsp;mobile phone and four hours of data per day,” he explained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Banerji spoke about the challenges that come with these advantages, which include&amp;nbsp;monetisation and breaking through the clutter. “It is a great bonanza time for consumers at large. While the time for consumers has never been better, at a platform level,&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;monetisation challenge continues to a big impediment to be able to achieve critical scale for their platform.  For consumers, with the abundance of content, there is this battle for&amp;nbsp;attention. However&amp;nbsp;the best story wins while rest is just noise,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warrier talked about the huge appetite for original content and how OTT customers are spoiled&amp;nbsp;for choice in what is&amp;nbsp;a non-disruptive experience. “Non-intrusive ad model is where we fit in because we are platform-agnostic. Apart from subscription model, there are ads running within the content. If you have seen the Cola brand in Sacred Games, it has been weaved as if it was always there, which is great advertising,” she said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aggarwal cited the latest PwC&amp;nbsp;report reiterating that&amp;nbsp;consumers will&amp;nbsp;now&amp;nbsp;be willing to pay. “If they aren’t going to pay, they will be okay with occasional ad-burst. And those looking for a seamless ad-free experience&amp;nbsp;will end up paying,” he said and stated SVOD, which is now a driving force.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Banerji maintained that the fact of the matter is that there are no right answers. “We have to keep trying out different business models. We’re still in an under-penetrated market. 70% plus time spent is time on&amp;nbsp;videos. Also TV is not going anywhere and the growth going to be happening there too. There is about 400 million-growth which is going to come on&amp;nbsp;the back of language,” he said.&amp;nbsp;Warrier opined that the AVOD&amp;nbsp;model will sustain with SVOD. “Subliminal advertising is potent and is the way forward,” she said.</news:description>

      <news:title>Senco’s latest campaign highlighting Karigari features Vidya Balan</news:title>
      <news:description>In its new campaign, Senco Gold &amp;amp; Diamonds, the renowned jewellery brand from Bengal, puts a different lens on craftsmanship.&amp;nbsp;Karigari&amp;nbsp;finds its significance and relevance through the stories of four different women from four different parts of the country - Women who find a reflection of their identity in the jewellery they choose to wear. Real, everyday women. With real stories. It is set to play up the fact that women, the Karigars&amp;nbsp;of life, are as unique as the pieces of adornment they choose for themselves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The multi-faceted and multi-talented Vidya Balan, has masterfully essayed these diverse characters. Suresh Triveni - the celebrated Director of&amp;nbsp;Tumhari Sullu,&amp;nbsp;teams up with Vidya and the crew that created&amp;nbsp;Sullu, to tell these stories and bring them alive in his characteristic style.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b5nqenNe_lA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Each of the four films narrates the way a woman finds herself, her life and her identity intertwined with the piece of jewellery that she wears. It traces the story of a Bengali woman who discovers that the time consuming art of filigree is similar to the time and patience that she needs to invest in making a relationship blossom. How she enjoys perfecting the relationship just like a&amp;nbsp;karigar&amp;nbsp;enjoys perfecting filigree work for a set of bangles. The second story is told in the modest voice of a housewife in Delhi. She acknowledges the importance of little indulgences and discovers her dazzle in the Karigari&amp;nbsp;of diamonds. The third story finds its protagonist in a South Indian woman. Someone who discovers that&amp;nbsp;karigari&amp;nbsp;can combine traditional values and modern outlook just the way she has never lost touch of her roots. And the last film helps a modern working woman, who believes in simplicity, find her match in the minimalistic and intricate Karigari&amp;nbsp;of lightweight jewellery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qyRY-NR8lXk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Sujoy Roy, Managing Partner (Creative) Ogilvy Kolkata: The task was to take Senco’s strength of craftsmanship to every corner of India as the brand extends its footprint across the nation. With this campaign we will help women, the&amp;nbsp;karigars&amp;nbsp;of life, discover another&amp;nbsp;karigar&amp;nbsp;in Senco. The story of Karigari&amp;nbsp;finds its role in the lives of these four women. And depicts how different forms of Karigari&amp;nbsp;helps reflect the true identity of every woman. Only an actor as versatile as Vidya Balan could do justice to these roles. Unlike other jewellery campaigns, this campaign doesn’t over-promise or create an eclectic space for jewellery. It is set in the real space. And it finds its voice through the stories of four relatable characters across the country.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

Each time a client praises our intricate designs, it is a credit to our craftsmen. We are fortunate to have them with us for years. In fact, some of the&amp;nbsp;karigars&amp;nbsp;have been with us for generations so they know everything when it comes to jewellery, modern or old; traditional or futuristic. This campaign is a tribute to the&amp;nbsp;karigars&amp;nbsp;who work untiringly to craft jewellery by their hands.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Love has no gender: Brands come all out in support of LGBTQ community after SC verdict</news:title>
      <news:description>In a historic judgement, the Supreme Court of India partially struck down Section 377, thereby decriminalising consensual adult gay sex. The verdict by the Apex court was welcomed by millions across the country. With this ruling, India has now joined the list of countries where homosexuality is not a crime.&lt;br&gt;Delivering the landmark judgment, Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra, said: "I am what I am. So take me as I am." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Soon after the verdict, brands extended their support to the LGBTQ community by changing profile pictures of their social media pages and posting interesting messages. Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram were full of rainbow colours, the symbol of the LGBTQ community. Hashtags like #section377, #section377scrapped, #section377verdict, #377, #377quitindia, #loveislove have been trending on social media since yesterday. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take a look at some interesting posts put up by brands hailing the Supreme Court verdict:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Axe India&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536288460_534tLZ_axe.jpg" style="width:443px;height:539px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bira 91&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536288499_S9Llwh_bira.jpg" style="width:443px;height:632px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burger King India &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536288552_chJYl0_burger.jpg" style="width:443px;height:548px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CEAT Tyres &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It was about time they squared the circle. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Section377?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Section377&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/377Verdict?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#377Verdict&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RideWithPride?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RideWithPride&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/2PKCZSv89B"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2PKCZSv89B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— CEAT TYRES (@CEATtyres) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CEATtyres/status/1037598966630817793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 6, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;!-- ELRTE_SCRIPT:script35145492417123925 --&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celio&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536288589_EeuhEj_celio.jpg" style="width:443px;height:586px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cello Writing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536288640_cxD3b9_cello_writing.jpg" style="width:443px;height:521px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duroflex &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536288690_X9v6km_duroflex.jpg" style="width:443px;height:606px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethos Watch Boutiques &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ethos with Love, Equality &amp;amp; Pride.

      <news:title>Indian brands value growth higher than global brands: David Roth, The Store, WPP</news:title>
      <news:description>Since its launch five years ago, the total value of the BrandZ Top 50 Indian brands grew 110% to $146.1 billion, as observed by BrandZ™ Most Valuable Indian Brands analysis by WPP and Kantar Millward Brown. This compares to a rise of 76% for the BrandZ Top 50 Chinese brands and 60% for the BrandZ Global Top 50 over the same period. David Roth, CEO, The Store, WPP, EMEA and Asia shares his thoughts on the rising trends in India, increasing premiumisation and what makes Indian shoppers different from others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While coming out with BrandZ report for India, China and other countries what differences have you noticed between them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;China’s top 10 brands are dominated by technology and internet service providers (social network, search companies and e-commerce). India's top 10 is dominated by financial services, which are banks and insurances. When we started ranking China eight years back it was dominated by financial institutions.  So there has been a significant shift to entrepreneurial and technology company. One would expect a similar shift over the next five years in India to technology-related brands, which will become more important in ranking and the value that they create. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to the rest of the world, the last 12 years has seen a gradual shift in the global rankings from FMCG to big technology companies such as Amazon, Google, Twitter and Facebook. It will happen in India as well. This year itself we have Flipkart and payment app Paytm. So watch this space.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Around two-third of brands in 2018 India ranking score high in premium. Your comments on the trend?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a very interesting trend because it's more and more difficult to convince your consumers to pay more in terms of raising your price for the same product. But I think they are more willing to pay. Premiumisation is a very good way to demonstrate superior value. Products themselves need to be better. Both in India and China there has been a growth of premium sector. &lt;br&gt;As consumers become more sophisticated and have disposable income, the right brand with the right proposition will enter premium sector of the market, demonstrating product superiority and innovation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HDFC Bank as been the undisputed leader in BrandZ report. How are they getting it right? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would say constant focus on the consumer, a way of understanding of useful innovation to the customer and consistency. Consistency is the essence of great and valuable brands. They demonstrated true consistency of what they stand for, which is over and above making profit. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apart from HDFC which brands have cracked the code when it comes to brand value? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is Flipkart. Maruti Suzuki has a really interesting proposition. Surf has been consistent, and has been taking a very different stand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value of top brands soars 34% on year in BrandZ Most Valuable Indian Brands. What are the factors?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The companies have been doing well financially in the last few years. Also majority of brands are performing significantly better in customer research and bonded well with customers. It's a double whammy because it's both finance and brand. That brought significant increase in brand value. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sum up the report of this year for us in three points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Indian brands value growth over the last five years is significantly higher than both Chinese and global brands. The second point will be the importance of innovation. The third point will be importance of driving meaningful differentiation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is the modern Indian shopper different from the rest?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The modern Indian shopper is more price conscious. They have access to small retail stores (in grocery sector) from whom they get tremendous service. This is unmatched by any other country. Those stores give fantastic service of great value and customer satisfaction. I think that’s one of the reasons why organised trade and internet have found to difficult to enter this sector and compete. &lt;br&gt;Also, Indians are becoming increasingly brand conscious.</news:description>

      <news:title>BrandZIndia Awards 2018: HDFC retains top spot fifth year in a row </news:title>
      <news:description>At the fifth edition of WPP and Kantar Millward Brown's BrandZ Top 75 Most Valuable Indian Brands 2018 Awards, HDFC Bank, LIC India, TCS,&amp;nbsp;Airtel and&amp;nbsp;SBI were announced as the top 5 winners of the most valuable brands category. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;HDFC Bank retained its top position, five years in a row, with a rise of 21 per cent in its brand value to USD 21.7 billion. One of the largest insurers in India, LIC India made it to the second spot. This was followed by Tata Consultancy Services, Airtel and SBI grabbing the third, fourth and fifth spots respectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536289051_SzaKTf_IMG_2720-%281%29.jpg" style="width:443px;height:232px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking to exchange4media, Parag Rao, Country Head of Card Payment Products, Merchant Acquiring Services and Marketing at HDFC Bank Ltd, said, "In our journey up, over the last 20 years to where we are today and to our continued journey of us being a digital bank, we have learnt a thing or two about the customer. It&amp;nbsp;is about how you touch the customer's heart and keep delivering that experience consistently, so that he can prepose his trust in you. Our customers have preposed their trust in us and one of the reflections is this award." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536289007_sNj1Ur_image_6483441-%287%29.jpg" style="width:443px;height:232px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the win, Dinesh Menon, Chief Marketing Officer of State Bank of India,&amp;nbsp;shared," Winning this award is indeed an indication of the consumer's trust in the brand. For a large organisation such as SBI, these awards are a nudge in the right direction which recognises our efforts." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Biscuit- brand, Britannia India made the cut in the Most Valuable Food and Beverage brand category, while Zee TV bagged the award for the most valuable entertainment brand while ITC (Goldflake) became the most valuable tobacco brand. The Fastest Riser for 2018 was bagged by Tanishq as it grew over 97 per cent in the past year. Flipkart (Most valuable e-commerce brand), Surf Excel (most valuable home-care brand) and Maruti Suzuki (most valuable automotive brand) were among the other winners. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536289051_gmINCU_IMG_2721-%281%29.jpg" style="width:443px;height:232px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While delivering the keynote, HUL's MD &amp;amp; CEO Sanjiv Mehta mentioned that the chemistry of winning trust is when brands put consumers first,&amp;nbsp;find purpose, clarity, transparency, and functionality. "Trust is like a paper, once crumpled, it can't be perfect," said Mehta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vishikh Talwar, MD, Kantar Millward Brown, decoded the five core messages from India's most valuable brands, saying, "Premiumisation, Differentiation, Trust, Digital and Salience."</news:description>

      <news:title>Zee5 business will break even in 3-5 years: Punit Goenka, MD &amp; CEO, ZEEL &#13;
&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>India is witnessing a growth in digital media consumption and more and more viewers are taking to watching content on video over-the-top (OTT) platforms. This increase in the consumption on OTT platforms has fuelled talks of television viewing&amp;nbsp;taking a hit. However, Punit Goenka, MD &amp;amp; CEO of ZEEL, is not worried. He says the television medium too has been witnessing growth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd (ZEEL) operates in both the domain. Earlier this year, they launched their OTT platform Zee5.  In a conversation with exchange4media, Goenka talks about the two mediums. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said, “While we are seeing a lot of traction on OTT platforms, there is no worry yet on the television side of consumption. If you look at the growth in the TV segment, last year, we saw an increase&amp;nbsp;in the number of TV households. Also, we have seen growth in the consumption time of a consumer on a daily basis.” &lt;br&gt;“But having said that, Zee5 is definitely going to be our next big bet when it comes to investment and cornering incremental and additional viewers. We will soon be making more investments in that business. We are very confident that we will be able to deliver upwards of 30 per cent margin for the company as a whole despite these investments.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Goenka, Zee5 business will break even in 3-5 years. “It will be a journey of 3-5 years… may be towards the five year mark. We are seeing great traction on Zee5. It will definitely start adding to the advertising growth by this quarter itself. And within FY19 itself, it will add to the subscription growth of the company,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goenka mentioned that ZEEL will be investing close to about 400 basis points of topline in Zee5 for the current year. It will then decrease. He shared, “The revenue that Zee5 is generating is ahead of our expectation. And this gives us more confidence to invest in Zee5.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the competition from international and national players such as Netflix and Amazon, Goenka said Zee5 is on the track to become the Number 1 entertainment app in India over the next 12 months. He, however, refused to give subscription numbers as Q2 results are just around the corner. But he said that Zee5 videos views are growing by 50 per cent month on month. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brokerage firm Morgan Stanley recently downgraded ZEEL stock to 'underweight' from 'overweight'. &lt;br&gt;Talking about the report, Goenka said it is not very well researched. “On the television side itself, we are today delivering margins upwards of 36 per cent. And given the kind of investment we want to make on Zee5, we are confident that we will continue to deliver upward of 30 per cent margin even in FY21.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the trend of ad revenue shifting from television to OTT, Goenka said one cannot estimate when this will happen. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“I am pretty confident that TV itself is growing both on advertising and subscription sides. The Phase III of monetisation has started and we are seeing good traction coming on the subscription side as well. My own estimate is that Zee5 will positively contribute towards the entire company’s revenue as well as profitability in the long term.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Goenka also talked about their deal with Jio not working out. “We had a deal with Jio and it was up for renewal, but our negotiation failed. So we had to pull out all our content. The conversation is still on and I am sure we will find some solution,” he concluded.</news:description>

      <news:title>BrandZ Report bridges the gap between CMOs and CFOs: CVL Srinivas, WPP</news:title>
      <news:description>Brands need to take digitisation and trust very seriously to be valued by consumers, said WPP and Kantar Millward Brown top executives at the launch of the fifth annual WPP and Kantar Millward Brown BrandZ™ Most Valuable Indian Brands study.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Summarising the findings of the report, CVL Srinivas, Country Manager of WPP, said, “What is clearly coming out of the study over the last few years is that brands that stay meaningful to their customers, are differentiated, and have saliency are the ones that not only stay on top but also consistently top the list. One of the sub-themes that is coming out strongly these days is that brands need to build trust with consumers.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Digital cannot be an afterthought in the marketing strategy and has to be an integral part of a brand’s strategy,” said Vishikh Talwar, Managing Director at Kantar Millward Brown, South Asia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt; &lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536288416_eAgHtg_India2018.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brands are the most valuable asset for any company and there is no better time to invest in brand building, Srinivas felt. “Creating brand value leads to a huge amount of enterprise value. In this day and age when most companies are under pressure, we believe that there is no better time than now to look at brand building as a serious investment exercise just because of the enterprise value it can create,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At a time when the CFOs are making the decisions on investments, BrandZ is a ready reckoner for clients on brand building as it “bridges the gap between the CMO and the CFO,” Srinivas said. “This is the only study of its kind that puts a tangible value to a brand and helps make the case internally for investment."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Srinivas added&amp;nbsp;that the report ties together all the businesses across WPP. “We are forging a lot more collaboration amongst all the WPP operating companies. The BrandZ report is one of the best connectors we have within WPP to bring all of us together because a study like this is useful to all our businesses be that our content, media, branding, PR businesses.” &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Footprint a Must&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital is a must especially in the customer-facing service sector. "I do not recommend that every brand has to go digital,&amp;nbsp;if it makes sense go digital,” Talwar said. According to him the service sector, which has been about delivering experiences, is seeing a growing need to deliver good digital experiences. “This is not just limited to what is in the brand’s control, but even what people are saying about the brand on various platforms. So it is the entire digital footprint of a brand that is gaining relevance,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talwar said that the conversation among brands now has moved from ‘I need to have an app’ to ‘I need to have the best app.’ “If a brand is engaging with consumers, digital is no longer just a tick mark,” Talwar said. The role of the digital interface has become very significant to delivering the experience, he feels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rural India Driving Growth&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Premiumisation emerged as one&amp;nbsp;of the key&amp;nbsp;trends in the market, driving brand value for consumers. This applies to rural India too. “Premiumisation is not restricted to the top end of the market. It’s just a trend of upgrading; if I move from economy to popular I am moving up the ladder,” Talwar explained. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As rural India grows it is perhaps “upgrading its choice of brands at a&amp;nbsp;faster rate than urban India,” Talwar said. Noting that rural India is a relatively difficult space to reach, Talwar said that brands are calling out to rural consumers and giving them relevant messages at relevant time points. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patanjali Slowing Down&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Local brands are growing faster than MNC brands,” said Preeti Reddy, CEO Kantar South Asia. “They are understanding local needs better and are not bound by many of the processes and stage gates that a multinational company has to go through before innovating for the market,” she said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, Patanjali’s performance is plateauing, Talwar said. “Demonetisation and GST hit Patanjali too and perhaps harder than the MNCs, but there have been product quality issues and their sales have flattened. It is now a wait and watch about how they recover from this set-back,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Patanjali had an edge because it found an area which was relatively vacant and thereby disrupted that space. “But now established players are encroaching into that area by launching similar products. How they now promote their brand and engage with consumers will determine how they perform over&amp;nbsp;the next few years,” Talwar said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why BSFI and Telecom Rule?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the fifth year in a row HDFC bank has topped the BrandZ list of top brands.&amp;nbsp;The top 75 brands list is dominated by BFSI and telecom brands. “This is because they have been running their business well and kept their conversation with consumers right. We don’t think it is an exciting category but the key point is that in the space that they operate, they innovate very fast. The amount of changes in the banking or loans structure to make them tuned to the consumer needs is exemplary. They have heard consumers and are&amp;nbsp;making those changes,” Talwar said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative News is Bad Publicity&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brands such as&amp;nbsp;Air India, Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, which have all made headlines for the wrong reasons and are on the top 75 brands list, run the risk of seeing a decline in brand valuation. “Negative news about a brand impacts brand valuation very much. The brand valuation for Maggi had dropped by around 50% during the time it was embroiled in controversy. A strong brand that commits a mistake can make a comeback if it accepts its mistakes and makes amends,” Talwar pointed out.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding the Study&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;To give a holistic view of the industry, the study this year added growing sectors such as technology (IT services), technology (online); durables and home appliances, tobacco, and entertainment (TV stations). The team has also added privately owned brands, where financial information is publicly available, and unicorn brands, to the scope of the study. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yet, the report does miss out on studying some key brands whose financial reports are not publicly available. “It unfortunate that a few brands get missed out but the brands that are getting missed out are far fewer than the brands that are being included in the study,” said Talwar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He added that even if foreign companies were studied in the Indian context, this Top 75 list would remain more or less the same barring the inclusion of brands such as&amp;nbsp;Google, Facebook and Vodafone.</news:description>

      <news:title>Cricket has become a strong performing genre for Swiggy: Srivats TS, VP Marketing, Swiggy</news:title>
      <news:description>The countdown to Asia Cup has begun. There is a good prospect of arch rivals India and Pakistan taking on one another, an opportunity for brands to garner the maximum eyeballs. Srivats TS- VP Marketing, Swiggy, gets talking to us on how brands can leverage such intense cricket tournaments to its maximum effect:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us how cricket can be used as a vehicle for brand building?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cricket and food are two of India’s biggest passions. Over the past few months, we have found cricketing events to be a great platform as they place brands like us right where the consumer is present organically. With users tuning in every day to catch the cricketing action, it presents a unique opportunity to maximize the contextuality and reach of our campaigns. Unlike a lot of other brands for whom cricket is a great media vehicle only, we believe that Swiggy is a brand that can generate a transaction and a great food ordering experience right when the consumer is viewing the ad. The cricket season brings with it an opportunity to appeal to a wider demographic who are connected by a love for entertainment, food and having both of these delivered to them in the most convenient and seamless manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swiggy has come up with some memorable cricket campaigns. What is the idea behind them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cricketing tournaments like IPL have presented a great opportunity for us to reach out to potential new users who may not have used the platform before and bring out our brand benefits in an engaging manner. Our IPL campaign was our endeavor to get many more users to make Swiggy a part of their daily lives and it has been a very successful campaign to that effect. While our core consumption audience lies in the 18-35 age group segment, we’ve seen a growth in consumers outside of that TG as well. Cricket has been a strong performing genre for Swiggy, and with the T20 season being the largest cricketing event of the year, we felt it was the right time to invest into accelerating penetration and leadership mindshare. There were a series of integrated campaigns that Swiggy ran throughout the IPL season such as Match Day Mania, our various TVCs that saw great resonance from the audience and some in-game innovations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How effective are cricket campaigns when one wants to drive ROI?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brands that are able to define their role-in-life clearly and leverage cricket to bring that alive meaningfully will be able to create impact and engagement with consumers during cricket tournaments. For example, our IPL-themed advertisements explored relatable scenarios that have made Swiggy a household name today. Whether it’s a married couple or a group of friends watching the big matches together, the idea was to showcase Swiggy’s role in life of the consumer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can brands do to leverage intense cricket tournaments?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sports, entertainment and food go hand-in-hand and we believe it is the perfect opportunity for brands to engage with consumers in a seamless manner.</news:description>

      <news:title>AI will diversify human thinking, not replace it: Tata Communications Study</news:title>
      <news:description>Tata Communications released a new study based on input from 120 global business leaders that envisions a positive impact of AI in the future. The study identifies how AI can diversify human thinking rather than replace it and also identifies opportunities for businesses and employees based on insights from leaders such as Tony Blair, Executive Chair of the Institute of Global Change and former UK Prime Minister, who predicts, "AI will allow us to do what it is that we are uniquely meant to do: focus on high-level thinking, strategy, and paving the way for innovation."&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ken Goldberg, UC Berkeley professor and co-author of the report, notes, “The prevalent narrative around AI has focussed on a ‘Singularity’ – a hypothetical time when artificial intelligence will surpass humans. But there is a growing interest in ‘Multiplicity’, where AI helps groups of machines and humans collaborate to innovate and solve problems. This survey of leading executives reveals that Multiplicity, the positive and inclusive vision of AI, is gaining traction.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Co-author Vinod Kumar, CEO and Managing Director at Tata Communications, says, “AI is now being viewed as a new category of intelligence that can complement existing categories of emotional, social, spatial, and creative intelligence. What is transformational about Multiplicity is that it can enhance cognitive diversity, combining categories of intelligence in new ways to benefit all workers and businesses.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to the survey of 120 leading executives, the study included 15 in-depth interviews with entrepreneurs, executives and thought-leaders, as well as discussion forums that brought together internationally renowned experts from the fields of AI, machine learning, design, art, government, politics, ethics, entrepreneurship, behavioural economics, journalism, engineering and human resources.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other key findings: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI can enhance cognitive diversity within groups&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is growing consensus that diversity of thinking on projects yields better outputs. Business executives believe that AI could help create and maintain working groups that optimise this cognitive diversity.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI can help workers become more agile, curious, and nimble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost all (93%) business leaders agree that AI can enhance employee engagement. AI has potential to assess each employee’s skills and innovation priorities, and suggest activities to spark creative thinking throughout the organisational hierarchy. This can democratise the creative process and increase engagement of all workers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI can enhance human collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Business is increasingly multicultural, but a lack of understanding of languages and cultures can be a barrier to collaboration. Most (80%) of leaders surveyed agree that AI could facilitate team composition, organisation and communications, especially for global teams.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The structure of work will change and require greater agility and flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most (75%) executives envision AI creating new roles in their businesses.  AI has potential to free employees from tedious repetitive tasks, allowing them to focus much more on communication and innovation. Work will move from being task-based to strategic, enabling workers to enhance their curiosity and creative thinking. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>TRAI Tariff Order: Delhi High Court relists the matter to September 11</news:title>
      <news:description>The Delhi High Court, on September 6, relisted the TRAI tariff framework matter to September 19.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Delhi High Court was hearing pleas by direct-to-home platforms Bharti Telemedia Ltd owned Airtel Digital TV, and Tata Sky Ltd, challenging the validity of the tariff regulations issued by the authority.&lt;br&gt;On September 5, the Supreme Court could not hear the matter pertaining to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) tariff order and interconnection regulation and adjourned it to September 11. The Apex court adjourned the petition as the matter could not come up for hearing before lunch. And post lunch, a special bench was scheduled to conduct proceedings in the court.&lt;br&gt;On July 3, 2018, TRAI had implemented the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable) Interconnection (Addressable Systems) Regulations 2017 after it was upheld by the Madras High Court with an exception. While bringing the order into effect on July 3, the TRAI had prescribed timelines for the stakeholders. The deadline for compliance was August 31, 2018. &lt;br&gt;Following the deadline, most of the major broadcasters have published their Reference Interconnect Offer (RIO) along with the Interconnection Agreement. Big broadcasters, including Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited, Sony Pictures Networks India Private Limited and TV18 Broadcast Limited, have declared their RIOs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This RIO shall be effective for the term commencing from 29-December-2018 (i.e., at the end of 180 days from the date of TRAI’s press release dated 3-July-2018, read with TRAI’s notifications dated 3-March-2017),” reads the RIO published by TV18 Broadcast Ltd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, Zee, in line with the tariff order, announced multiple bouquets catering to consumers of different languages across India. All Zee channels will be available on a-la-carte basis, as required by the Regulations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Star India, which is one of the petitioners against TRAI tariff and interconnect order, is yet to file its RIO.</news:description>

      <news:title>We'll have to wait &amp; watch if print growth will match revenue: I Venkat, Eenadu</news:title>
      <news:description>Starting his career at Eenadu, I Venkat, Director, Eenadu, has spent over four decades with the group and helped build Eenadu into one of the leading regional media organisations in the country and the largest read Telugu news daily with 1.58 crores readership, according to the Indian Readership Survey (IRS). Speaking to exchange4media, Venkat discusses about the challenges facing the Print industry, growth of Eenadu and why media planning is a tarkari business today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here are the edited excerpts of the interview:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has Eenadu Group performed over the year?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Overall Eenadu has done well. The two main verticals, Print has done well while Television has done better. Print saw single-digit growth and I think we should be happy with that. We recently launched four Radio stations (E FM in Tirupati, Vijayawada, Warangal and Rajahmundry in July 2018) and Radio is just a small play right now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you looking to increase the cover price, particularly since newsprint prices have significantly increased?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have not increased the cover price, however we are contemplating doing it. We also have to bear in mind, when we do increase the price, what will be the impact of the circulation loss. We are debating that internally and we will take a call on that as far as the price increase is concerned. Yes, newsprint prices are going up, it is a problem not just for us but for the entire Print industry in India. Added to that, we also have the problem of the dollar (weakening of the Rupee to the Dollar).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As per the last IRS (Indian Readership Survey) data, Eenadu is the largest read Telugu daily. However, how do you perceive&amp;nbsp;competition?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;IRS only reflected what is on the ground. As far as we are concerned, the position which we are in, it translated it into readership figures. As for competition, one cannot wish it away in any business. Competition will be there for each publication or TV channel, what one has to try and do is to be better than competition, in terms of how we increase our circulation; that means the content has to be good and content changes have to be made, which we are doing constantly. For the last 30 years, we have been pioneers in content change. We were the first to launch a district newspaper, focus on hyper-localisation and launch constituency pages for each assembly constituency. In addition, we recently launched seven features. Eenadu is no longer just a newspaper, it has everything for the family and in terms of content, it is almost like a magazine. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you see the future of Print in India? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Print will never die in India. My own feeling is that at least for the next couple of years you will see, if not the same level of growth, a marginal growth in the newspaper industry in India. Whether the revenue amount will match the growth is a thing we have to wait and watch. If Print is growing at x percentage, then will revenues also grow at the same percentage, that is something I am not in the position to forecast today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the competitive Telugu GEC space, ETV Telugu is currently behind Star Maa, Zee Telugu and Gemini TV. What should be done for ETV to regain its leadership? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The content, ie. software, has to keep changing to keep with the times and in tune with the viewer’s requirement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking at Digital, how do you see this medium contributing to revenues?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of revenue, at this juncture, Digital in India for any newspaper is not even 2-3% of the total revenue. I am not saying it will remain at that but I don’t see it growing in a remarkable way for the simple reason that the rates are so low that even if you get 100% increase, the revenue will still be marginal. Unless the rates undergo some phenomenal change across the industry, it is difficult for the revenue to grow for the Print industry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is subscription&amp;nbsp;the way to go?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I understand that Manorama has already started, and&amp;nbsp;others are also discussing. I have been a party to one discussion where everyone feels that the time has come where we need to&amp;nbsp;pay. These are discussions&amp;nbsp;so I am sure that if not tomorrow, in the&amp;nbsp;months to come,&amp;nbsp;one by one everybody will start putting up a paywall and charge something nominal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you look at bidding for more Radio stations in&amp;nbsp;future auctions?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now that we have started, we will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is early days but how has Radio play worked so far?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have not really done&amp;nbsp;much of work in the marketplace as yet for advertisers to take note of our channels. Communication has just started, and slowly it is percolating down. However, as we are not in the Hyderabad market, my own hunch is that the route that we go and tell them may not work. The route has to be that local business players on the client side – dealers and distributors, if they find that programs are good, they will tell their principal&amp;nbsp;about the station. This way it will go back into the system to the agencies and client. That is the better route. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the challenge for regional players as media planning becomes commoditised?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is no longer planning, I think the agency should scrap the word planning in their departments completely. It is all commodity buying, that’s it, it is like ‘tarkari’ business. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking from an advertiser and agency point of view, all they have to do is differentiate between quality and quantity. If you want quality and want to reach a certain set of people, take the quality vehicle. If you want quantity pick something else. Everybody does that. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking ahead, where do you see the growth coming from?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We see semi-urban markets and rural markets growing. Even the urban markets are growing. Overall it is quite good, not only for us but every newspaper across the country is seeing a certain amount of growth, some more, some less, that depends from market to market.</news:description>

      <news:title>Mullen Lintas wins creative mandate for PharmEasy</news:title>
      <news:description>Following what was a closely contested multi-agency pitch, PharmEasy awarded&amp;nbsp;their creative mandate to Mullen Lintas. The Mumbai office of Mullen Lintas will handle the business. The agency made the cut on the back of its robust experience with consumer-facing businesses and a comprehensive understanding of the consumer and the healthcare business, said a statement from Mullen Lintas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Founded in 2015, PharmEasy is in the business of helping users connect with local pharmacy stores and diagnostic centres in order to fulfil their broad medical needs. Currently, they cater to 22000 pin codes across the country while continually expanding their nation-wide presence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to a recent report by Grand View Research, the global health-tech market is anticipated to reach $104.5 Bn by 2020.

      <news:title>MediaMath, Integral Ad Science &amp; Rubicon Project join Mindshare for blockchain alliance</news:title>
      <news:description>Mindshare and blockchain platform Zilliqa are building a programmatic alliance on blockchain designed to explore the application of the technology in the advertising ecosystem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The aim of the alliance is to realistically assess the applicability of blockchain technology into the world of advertising where billions of impressions are viewed online, by testing two critical components of this technology – one on the throughput and the other to arrive at the right consensus protocol. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The alliance includes multiple businesses in the programmatic advertising supply chain including advertisers, advertising agencies, Demand Side Platforms (DSPs), Supply Side Platforms (SSPs), Data Management Platforms (DMPs), trading desks, independent verification companies and publishers. It also has the potential to include key opinion leaders or industry experts, if required.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mindshare and Zilliqa have partnered with MediaMath, Rubicon Project and Integral Ad Science in developing the first prototype - “Project Proton” – which aims to transform the current programmatic advertising ecosystem by providing a way for all the stakeholders across the value chain to interact in a secure and verifiable manner through smart contracts on a high throughput blockchain. This makes it suitable for the enterprise level implementation of the project for all the partners involved in a transparent manner so that all the actors in the ecosystem can completely trust each other allowing the entire programmatic ad space to grow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The key members of Project Proton Alliance Are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•  Mindshare: Mindshare is a global media planning and buying agency that is part of WPP. It has 8,500 employees across 116 offices in 86 countries and global revenues of USD34.5bn annually.

Zilliqa also provides a secure and efficient smart contract layer to enable secure-by-design smart contract programming and verification.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•  MediaMath: MediaMath helps leading global marketers deliver personalized digital advertising across all connected touchpoints. Over 9,500 marketers in 42 countries use MediaMath’s enterprise software every day to launch, analyze, and optimize their digital advertising campaigns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•  Rubicon Project: Founded in 2007, Rubicon Project is one of the world’s largest advertising exchanges. The company helps websites and apps thrive by giving them tools and expertise to sell ads easily and safely. In addition, the world's leading agencies and brands rely on Rubicon Project’s technology to execute billions of advertising transactions each month. Rubicon Project is an independent, publicly traded company (NYSE:RUBI) headquartered in Los Angeles, California&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•  Integral Ad Science (IAS): A global software company, headquartered in New York, that builds verification, optimization, and analytics solutions, acting as leaders in viewability, brand safety and ad fraud.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•  Underscore CLT:  Underscore CLT develops cryptographic ledger technologies to power real business solutions for marketers and their partners.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mindshare announced a partnership with Zilliqa last year to build blockchain applications for the digital advertising industry. Project Proton is the first phase of this partnership that will evaluate how Zilliqa’s blockchain protocol can address some of the potential applications of this technology to the advertising industry. Findings should be ready before the end of the year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are absolutely delighted and thankful to have MediaMath, IAS, Rubicon Project and Underscore CLT partner with us on this project with Zilliqa. There are many claims and speculations on the applicability of this technology to our business. Project Proton is designed to test this, particularly in the areas of building consensus and managing high throughput,” said Gowthaman Ragothaman, Chief Development Officer, Mindshare AMENA.</news:description>

      <news:description>Sony Pictures Networks (SPN) India has acquired exclusive television and digital rights for UEFA Euro 2020 and inaugural UEFA Nations League.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the acquisition, SPN has become the official broadcaster of eight premier international football properties in the Indian subcontinent, including UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League, LaLiga, Serie A, UEFA Super Cup and the FA Cup, the company said in a statement.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All the action will also be available for exclusive live streaming on SPN’s OTT platform, SonyLIV. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the acquisitions, Rajesh Kaul, Chief Revenue Officer Distribution and Head - Sports, Sony Pictures Networks India, said, “Our objective is to bring the best footballing action from around the world making the sports channels of SPN the premier destination for all sports fans.

We are delighted to acquire the rights for the UEFA Nations League and UEFA EURO 2020.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“2018 FIFA World Cup Russia showed us the strength of European football with European teams winning the last four editions of the World Cup. The World Cup has also shown us that the need for international football tournaments is very high with fans looking for more than just international friendlies. As the ‘Home of Football’ SPN will give fans the best experience to see the best clubs, teams, and players in the world,” he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The UEFA Nations League has been created for the 55-member nations of UEFA, the European governing body of football.

The inaugural edition of the UEFA Nations League is set to kick off this week and includes 2018 FIFA World Cup champion France along with Croatia, Belgium, Germany, England, Spain, Portugal and more.

The first week features France v Germany, England v Spain and Portugal v Italy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 16th edition of UEFA EURO 2020 is going to be unique as it is not going to be hosted by one country, but rather spread out across the whole continent. As many as 12 cities in 12 different countries will host matches, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the tournament. The EURO 2020 will run from 12th June – 12th July in 2020 and will feature 24 teams. Qualifiers for the tournament will run from 21st March 2019 – 31st March 2020.

      <news:title>Dream11 partners with CleverTap </news:title>
      <news:description>Mobile marketing automation solution provider CleverTap has announced that sports gaming platform Dream11 is extensively using its comprehensive data-driven user engagement suite to further consolidate its position in the            competitive fantasy sports market. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Launched in&amp;nbsp;2012, Dream11 now has&amp;nbsp;over 40 million users in India, claimed a statement released by CleverTap. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Catering to a diverse target of sports fans with evolving sensibilities and sacrosanct loyalties, Dream11 aims to complement the entire sports consumption experience across both web and mobile channels. CleverTap’s AI/ML-powered platform is helping Dream11 craft personalised, contextual, and timely engagement campaigns to drive higher app monetization and retention, the statement mentioned. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;To create personalised campaigns, Dream11 leverages CleverTap’s automated segmentation capability that uses RFM (recency, frequency and monetary) analysis to segment its user base into 10 distinct segments. With RFM, Dream11 is able to discover its champions, loyal users, and those that are at-risk or hibernating. By keeping track of user activity and their monetary values, they are able to run targeted campaigns to reduce at-risk and hibernating users over time while also running loyalty programmes to keep their champions and loyal users coming back.  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Using CleverTap Journeys, Dream11 can now visually build highly effective push notification campaigns based on specific historical and real-time in-app user actions or inactions. Dream11 is also leveraging the power of rich push notifications by embedding their “Dimaag Se Dhoni” campaign slogan as an accompanied sound in their notification. Not only does this help their notifications stand out, but also adds an interesting dimension to the entire user experience. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Talking about the association, Rahul Mirchandani, VP of Customer Retention at Dream11, said, “We are fast changing the way a sports fan consumes sports by providing them a highly immersive second screen experience. Playing on Dream11 requires the application of both creative imagination and rational thinking. In such a scenario, converting infrequent users into repeat customers through effective and timely mobile marketing campaigns is of utmost importance.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He further elaborated, “CleverTap’s automated segmentation engine helps us harness user-level behavioural insights to craft engagement strategies that drive higher monetisation and retention. Using their advanced marketing automation platform, we believe we can extensively tap into the sporting interests and loyalties of sports fans and provide a great product experience.”  &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sunil Thomas, CEO of CleverTap, said, “The rapid evolution of fantasy sports as an engagement and monetisation opportunity has been remarkable. Dream11’s rise in terms of scale as the go-to fantasy sports platform in India has been noteworthy.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Our advanced automated segmentation engine helps Dream11 identify different user segments that need to be engaged with across devices through personalized and contextual notifications. Also, these have to be delivered at the right time to maximize chances of users coming back to the platform to strategically make their teams. We are thrilled to be powering the growth of India’s largest and most loved fantasy sports platform and are excited to see what lies in store next,” he added.</news:description>

      <news:title>Regional channels making their presence felt nationally: S Divaakar, First News </news:title>
      <news:description>S Divaakar, who has been instrumental in the launch and growth of prominent Kannada news channels such as TV9, Public TV, ETV Kannada news, has completed 25 years in the media industry. He has now joined the soon-to-be-launched First News Kannada channel as the Head of Sales and Marketing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Divaakar began his career as a sales executive in Udaya TV when the channel was launched in 1994, post which he has worked with popular channels Gemini TV, Jaya TV, ETC, Zee Network, Sahara One, Filmy and TV9. Divaakar speaks about his 25 years in media, the soon-to-be launched First News Channel, changes he has witnessed in Kannada viewership, media selling and more. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your 25 years of journey in the media world?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;25 years in the media world has been a wonderful journey. While many people think that we are in a rather entertaining industry, no one knows that we are the bridge between Clients and Viewers. Media industry can be compared to an ocean wherein the more you deep dive, the more you learn. I have been delivered only treasures by many organisations where I have worked and learnt many aspects from all the ups and downs, which I have faced till now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It feels like yesterday, ever increasing complexity of media planning, a bundle choice to advertisers, shift of media consumption etc. has made my last 25 years a learning experience. So, what was valid a few years ago, stands null and void today. When I saw the evolution from TAM to BARC, I could see a sea change in approach and planning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have been fortunate enough to work with some of the best minds in the industry. To name a few, Clifford Pereira, Prem Kumar , V Madhusudhanan, Bikash Kundu, Sparsh Ganguli, Vijay Bobby, Sridhar Pongur, Liji Koshy, K Balaswaminathan, Ajay Ramanujam. Today while I continue my journey I’m also learning a lot from the younger generation and I’m in no hurry to stop.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us more about the soon-to-be-launched channel, First News. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The master minds behind this channel are Ravi Kumar and Maruti, they have been in the Media industry for a long time and are completely aware of the TV viewership pattern and pulse of Kannada viewers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;First News as a News Channel wants to stand “unique” compared to other Kannada news channels, which we will be proving in the coming days. We are all set to launch the channel and the date will be announced soon. News Genre is a known ambience to me. I know that I can get only pearls not castoffs this time, I am very affirmative about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What according to you are the significant changes Kannada media industry has undergone in terms of viewership pattern and programmes?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The media industry in Kannada has undergone a lot of changes over 25 years. Viewer number has significantly increased, content delivery has changed from orthodox news presenting style to chit chat version. Every programme has to be logical and has to deal with social causes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During those days we had something called Diary Panel, where a door-to-door survey was taken on channel and programme viewership. I have seen the changeover of measuring TV viewership pattern from Diary Panels to TAM and BARC. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot of Kannada channels have started in recent years where every channel is focused on breaking news and reaching the viewers first, but this has resulted in forgetting the real concept of news. Versatility is the key word in TV, viewers need various programmes from political shows to entertainment programmes. It is the duty of the people behind the channel to look into the programming needs of the viewers. Today viewers are bombarded with umpteen number of channels and because of that, people will not wait for a particular channel or show, it’s a humongous task for channels like us to maintain the regular viewership numbers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The regional markets for TV are showing growth due to improved measurement by the viewership monitoring agency Broadcast Audience Research Council India, which is now also measuring rural and regional markets. You have worked with almost all leading Kannada news channels in their nascent stages, so what according to you are the opportunities and challenges new entrant channels will have to face? Every channel has various opportunities and challenges, but how we cater to those opportunities and challenges are very important. As per my knowledge, if we provide the audience with quality and fact-oriented content, half the problem is solved. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Coming to news channels, it’s all about who breaks the news and reaches the audience first. But, while in the race to reach first, channels should focus on fact-oriented reporting. It is just not about delivering news first but also how much fact and truth a specific news story carries. Regional channels are making their presence felt nationally, digitisation is one main reasons behind this. As First News, we are gearing up to beat the challenges and accept all the opportunities that come our way. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the changes you have witnessed in media sales in the TV sector over the years?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Career opportunities in the sales sector has grown significantly. 25 years back, we struggled to build revenue for channels as there were few clients. Now with increased number of clientele revenue opportunities are vast. The Indian Media and Entertainment industry is on an inspiring growth path. The industry is projected to grow at a much faster rate than the global average rate. The huge success of sports properties like the Indian Premiere League and T20 World Cup were essential in providing a boost to advertising revenues. The telecast of these properties in regional languages helped channels in terms of revenue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;According to you,  where is the Kannada media industry headed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kannada Media industry has grown considerably in the past few years. It has carved its own niche in the media industry and proven that it is dynamic and a potential market for investors. Earlier the Kannada media industry had few corporate clients, now there are several corporate clients investing in the media industry to increase their revenue and sales. At First News, we are planning to cater to many clients in unique ways with best strategic plans.</news:description>

      <news:title>Kerala Floods: OOH industry faces loss of Rs 200cr, need 6 months to recover: Experts</news:title>
      <news:description>The state of Kerala and its economy is limping back to normalcy after the floods which devastated the state just few days ago. Reportedly, the disaster claimed around 400 lives and the state has incurred a loss of about Rs 21,000 crore overall. As a result of the flood, all the industries and businesses in the state have been affected quite adversely, that it was the Onam festive season, when advertising spends are at peak, made things even worse. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Onam, which marks the beginning of festive season in the country, is also a time when the entire marketing focus of not just local but even national brands shifts to Kerala. The advertising spends by brands witness a considerable rise during this season. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of the most widely affected media industries during the flood in Kerala was the Out Of Home (OOH) industry as there was severe loss of ad inventory and devastation of infrastructure across the state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to industry experts, the OOH industry has incurred a loss of almost&amp;nbsp;Rs 60 crore, just during the months of July-August. Overall, industry is estimated to incur a loss of Rs 200 crore as it will take 4-6 months for things to normalise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;K Vijayakumar, President, Kerala Advertising Industries Association said, “Onam season is a peak time for the OOH industry in terms of revenue and this year due to heavy rainfall and floods about 50 per cent of the campaigns were cancelled. Most of the hoardings remain vacant in the city. But the losses incurred by the OOH industry is due to clients backing off and campaign cancellations and not because of the destruction of properties. In fact, the hoardings and billboards are intact as there was less wind in the flood affected areas.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sreekumar PV, Secretary, Kerala Advertising Industries Association said, “The flood has hit he OOH industry very severely and it will take minimum 4-6 months to resume business. Clients backed off from the campaigns as it doesn’t seem sensible to run an advertisement campaign when the whole state of Kerala is suffering. But they have promised that they will come back to us when the state attains normalcy. The industry loss approximately will be Rs 200 crore, as the industry will be idle for another 4-6 months.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Firstly, it is very unfortunate that the state of Kerala has gone through a disaster like this, which claimed several lives. In terms of business, it’s a tough time for the OOH industry in the state as most of the spends in Kerala happens during the festive season. 50-60 % of spends happens during the months of August-September alone. Campaigns got postponed due to the calamity and an approximate loss of Rs 50-60 crore has occurred in these last two months alone,” said Haresh Nayak, Regional Director, Posterscope APAC &amp;amp; Managing Director, Posterscope Group.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Kerala OOH industry has a turnover of almost Rs 350 crore per year of which Onam season alone accounts 45 per cent. &lt;br&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Speaking to exchange4media, Chithra Prakash of Chitra Painters, one of the initial players in the OOH industry in Kerala, said, “The flood has affected the OOH industry of the state very badly. When the intensity of rain increased, and the situation was going out of hands, most of my clients backed off from the Onam campaigns. My firm alone incurred a loss of Rs 5-6 crore.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“OOH within the city limits were not affected by the rains. But places like Perumbavoor, Aluva, Paravoor, Thodupuzha, Chengannur, Ranni etc were severely affected by the rains and this has reflected in the OOH campaigns as well. The areas surrounding the Cochin International Airport is another important spot for the OOH industry in the Ernakulam district, and the closing down of airport for a few days also turned out to be a prime reason for cancelling of OOH campaigns by the clients. My estimate is that the OOH industry in Kerala has to face an approximate loss of Rs 150-200 crore,” added Prakash. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Even when the OOH industry is badly affected, the players didn’t stop themselves from helping the flood victims, they were actively involved in flood relief activities. The Kerala Advertising Industries Association has distributed around 2000 essential food kits to the flood victims in Alapuzha district and is also involved in other flood relief work,” added Sreekumar. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The state is now slowly limping back to normalcy. “According to me the state and the OOH industry is slowly getting back on track,” added Nayak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to all industry experts we spoke with, the OOH industry in Kerala will now take minimum 4-6 months to get back to its feet. Now the OOH players are pinning their hope on the Christmas season, which accounts to about 25-30 per cent of the revenue for the year.</news:description>

      <news:title>Travel high investment category both monetarily and emotionally: Pulkit Trivedi, Facebook</news:title>
      <news:description>Facebook recently released its fourth research report titled ‘Eliminating friction in travel path to purchase’ under its programme Zero Friction Future, exclusively for the Indian travel industry. Pulkit Trivedi, Director, Facebook India, spoke to us on how brands can leverage the platform of Facebook and thereby have a huge impact in influencing travellers’ purchase journey. Speaking on the implications of a mobile-savvy consumer behaviour on businesses, he said that brands will need to re-orient themselves in order to change the consumer experience, given the context of a hyper-connected online world today, where 70% of the internet traffic in India engages in video.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the video here or read the edited excerpts below&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ku7MaVRJImU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why should a travel brand use Facebook advertising for a frictionless consumer experience?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Travel is a high investment category both monetarily and emotionally. With India getting more smartphone savvy, it has dislodged plenty of traditional mediums in a consumer journey from the stage of awareness to purchase. In this journey we believe advocacy plays a critical role to influence a customer’s decision. There are two clear vectors as to how travel is bought on Facebook, one being the element of personalisation and the other regarding its relevance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When brands partner with us for advertising, they can very well figure out which part of the traffic came from Facebook and that which opted out. They can then choose to re-target those users who dropped out using our platform and encourage them to re-engage. So brands are able to see huge reach through the medium of Facebook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Facebook looking at creating a highly personalised booking experience for consumers so that travel brands too benefit out of it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Travel is getting more mobile dependent and Facebook as an app is heavily used by consumers on their mobile phones. Hence, we are able to offer significant reach to businesses and brands. We are a people-based marketing company, which helps our users stay updated about relevant products in the market through this very medium. As per our Global Web Index report, 2/5 users on Facebook actually discover a new product through mobile ads. Thirdly, Facebook’s travel intent signals helps it to categorise users into different cohorts, thereby making it a meaningful and engaging platform for its users. Lastly, consumers can also personalise and sequentialise a message on Facebook. It is important for businesses to engage with users in the pre-trip stage, during the trip and post trip-stage and this engagement is carried out in a sequence on Facebook.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With Facebook's association, how can brands start getting hotels to even the playing field between desktop and mobile, enabling travellers get access to competitive rates earlier in the search process compared to aggregator sites?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The install base of desktop is 60 million in India, which isn’t growing at a high rate. 75% of all online commerce happening in India is on mobile and a major part of it is through mobile apps. ASPs of what people are buying on mobile vs purchase being made on desktops is in equilibrium today. However, with the consumer journey being very fragmented, users can have various touch points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When brands deploy an ad on Facebook, our team wants to help them measure the RoI Vs every single dollar spent on the ad. For example, while working with MakeMyTrip, we witnessed 50% lower cost per booking on mobile app than any other channel, which is very meaningful to brands. In our mobile optimised campaign on Facebook we also saw a 5x increase in app installs for GoIbibo.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How is Facebook helping brands/travel companies organise themselves for digital success?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Firstly, through projects under our Zero Friction Future programme, we want to stimulate the industry to think of mobile and digital adoption. Mobile is at the centre of influencing so many billion dollars of revenue and the biggest disparity today is between the percentage of time spent on mobile Vs the percentage of money spent on mobile. Our spends on mobile be it ad or otherwise in building assets on cell phones is minuscule, hence the need of a mobile-centric strategy, which further adds to the digital success of brands. We want to help businesses by leveraging the reach of Facebook, such that brands build the right creative strategy for our platform. The biggest friction here is caused by offline media where ads are static and not interactive and immersive enough. Facebook can help brands adopt a creative strategy which is engaging enough as users consume video or content on a 5 inch screen very differently from that of a 42 inch screen. We want to work closely with marketers to help them improvise. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concerning hotels, how do you think brands should plug the trust issues to prevent dropouts of aware consumers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike airlines, for hotels one doesn’t have a single uniform brand experience to connect with. In this case, to increase the trust factor in our consumers we adapt ourselves to sequential messaging. Based on the positioning of the user within the funnel we sequentialise our message and accordingly make a pitch. For e.g. If I know there’s a trust factor associated with low cost hotels in India, I will treat this as a category building challenge and convince users with the most trusted best-in-class experience for this particular price. On the other hand if one drops out of the funnel, a powerful way is to re-engage or re-target users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming to air travel, what is the best way to engage young consumers (18-24 years), given their short attention span?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;62% of consumers who buy travel on Facebook are millennials who can’t be ignored. Some of the insights narrate that millennials do not pay attention to ads. Now, this means traditional medium is not the right way to catch their attention. As they spend more time on digital, the right way to go about this is to improvise on the creative assets that a brand has. While TV might have its own role to play, there are brands who have built several dollars without any participation of this traditional medium. We believe there’s every opportunity to start building a brand right here vs a TV-only brand. 70% of internet traffic in India is actually video. We believe, as we speak to millennials, that there’s every opportunity to start building a brand right here vs a TV.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can Facebook offer a frictionless consumer experience to those living in tier 2-3 cities, given that their behaviour is different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tier 2-3 cities are also embracing smartphones now. Their first screen on the internet is a smartphone, however the behaviour is different as they need more hand-holding to make the final purchase. They need to be told that it is a brand that they can trust. They also need hand-holding when it comes to various payment options at the intent or purchase stage. As per industry reports, the spend per household by 2020 on hotels will get close to about Rs. 1300 crore which thereby means that a lot of tier-2 consumers will resort to booking online and hence move away from traditional travel agents in the near future. Hence, we are emphasising on creating a seamless mobile experience starting with developing the mobile UX.</news:description>

      <news:title>Regional, Rural and FTA now key growth drivers for TV consumption: KPMG Report&#13;
&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>Despite the increasing consumption of TV content on digital platform, television still&amp;nbsp;remains the dominant mode of media consumption in India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;According to KPMG's recent report, Media Ecosystem: The walls fall down, the television industry in India is estimated at Rs 65,200 crore in FY18, a growth of 9.5 percent from FY17, having grown at a CAGR of 10.7 per cent between FY14-18. The market size consists&amp;nbsp;of advertising revenues of Rs 22,400 crore&amp;nbsp;and subscription revenue of Rs 42,800 crore in FY18.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The television industry had a relatively subdued year in FY18, with advertisement revenues facing headwinds due to the implementation of GST and moderate&amp;nbsp;growth in the overall economy. At the same time, subscription revenue growth was lower than&amp;nbsp;expected as the DD FreeDish subscriber base soared to 30 million and Direct To Home (DTH) ARPUs declined with an increase in competitive intensity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536201226_LBVHWM_kpmgtv.jpg" style="width:443px;height:336px;float:right"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the key trends in the television industry, Girish Menon, Partner and Head, Media and Entertainment, KPMG India, believes that going forward, regional market will drive growth. The launch of new channels and a wave of popular reality shows being adapted for regional audience&amp;nbsp;led to a 32 percent increase in languages viewership in 2017. The Free To Air (FTA) genre, that contributed 31 percent to TV viewership in 2017,&amp;nbsp;helped DD FreeDish become one of the largest DTH players in India. He says, “The building blocks of the future&amp;nbsp;has been set up in the&amp;nbsp;last two years. You had rural and regional demand growing. Regional is growing, particularly BARC started covering rural and regional in a&amp;nbsp;far&amp;nbsp;deeper manner. FTA market and regional market are becoming more and more important for broadcaster and distributors. With Free Dish, which is close to 30 million subscribers, offering a very low-cost product for the consumer to pick up, covering all the major content that is out there,&amp;nbsp;is helping TV consumption to grow.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the launch of new channels in the regional space&amp;nbsp;proves that it's a growing space,&amp;nbsp;the ad rates also increased along&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;consumption. Menon explains, “There was no need historically for the advertisers demand to be focused on the regional market directly. Advertisers, particularly on traditional media,&amp;nbsp;focus on the reach and it was the Hindi content that gives the maximum reach. With measurement metrics changing and becoming deeper&amp;nbsp;now the&amp;nbsp;situation is&amp;nbsp;where rural and regional viewers are getting captured more on television. Suddenly&amp;nbsp;advertisers started realising that there is a market where they haven’t spent&amp;nbsp;enough. In the next two-four years, as demand increases, the ad rates will go up (even more).” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even in the&amp;nbsp;FTA genre, the ad rates are going up, Menon says, “With FTA, because it is run by Doordarshan, it's not necessary that it follows the normal demand curve. The bidding on FTA channels has been stopped and now we have to see how it pans&amp;nbsp;out. I am assuming that Doordarshan will continue to allow third party channels&amp;nbsp;but potentially at a&amp;nbsp;higher price point. Once it happens, you will see more ad spends continuing to happen.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The number of TV households increased to 188 million in FY18 with the Cable &amp;amp; Satellite (C&amp;amp;S) subscriber base reaching 183 million. While cable and DTH aggregated 91 million and 62 million households respectively, FreeDish has gained a substantial user base and emerged as an alternative entertainment platform, especially in the DAS Phase III and IV markets. &lt;br&gt;“The operationalisation of digitisation continues to be slow while seeding of boxes has reached where it can. The conversion of packaging&amp;nbsp;the offerings has not yet started to happen. Coming to&amp;nbsp;TRAI&amp;nbsp;Tariff regulation, December end is when they will start operationalising. Our sense is that after the hearing it will bring in transparency across the value chain.”&lt;br&gt;The TV&amp;nbsp;industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.6 per cent on the back of increased&amp;nbsp;penetration and&amp;nbsp;strong advertising demand due to healthy&amp;nbsp;domestic consumption and major events (two cricket World Cups and General Elections being among them);&amp;nbsp;better distribution realisation&amp;nbsp;due to TV digitisation is likely to result in strong growth in the years to come. Lastly, while consumption of TV content on the digital platform is expected to grow further, television is likely to remain the dominant mode of media consumption in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Industry on revival path; will grow at 13.1% over next five years: KPMG Report</news:title>
      <news:description>A KPMG report on the media and entertainment sector projects advertising revenues to grow at a CAGR of 13.1 per cent over the next five years and reach Rs 2.6 lakh crore by 2023. The report attributes this growth to rapid growth and increase in digital user base and usage, growing domestic consumption, a strong rural demand and in particular upcoming cricket world cup and the general elections in 2019. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Presenting the report titled Media Ecosystems: The Walls Fall Down, Girish Menon, Partner, Media and Entertainment, said the industry is bouncing back from the challenges of 2017. “Our assessment is that the dip last year was fundamentally driven by specific challenges - GST, Demonetisation, RERA. These are one-time aspects and we don’t expect them to recur. Most companies have already recovered from the impact of these challenges and we have been seeing a lot of position traction over the last couple of quarters,” Menon said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report found that of the various sectors, digital will grow at the fastest pace of around 30 per cent, followed by TV at 12.6 per cent, radio at 10.2 per cent, OOH at 9.2 per cent and print at 5.9 per cent over the next five years. By 2023 digital revenues are expected to surpass both television and print revenues. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211426_Ey7Xx4_Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-11.26.jpg" style="width:450px;height:252px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211525_hYX2cf_Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-11.2602.jpg" style="width:450px;height:166px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 2017-18, television revenues grew by 9.5 per cent to reach Rs 65,200 crore in 2017-18. Print grew by 3.4 per cent, earning Rs 31,800 cr in revenues last year. Digital, which saw maximum growth of 35 per cent, is now making Rs 11,600 cr in revenues. Radio and OOH grew at 7.9 and 11.9 per cent respectively over the last year. Overall, the industry grew at 10.9 per cent in 2017-18. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211370_hU22D8_Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-11.25.jpg" style="width:450px;height:281px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211465_2aeLY7_Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-11.2502.jpg" style="width:450px;height:176px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Digital consumption has become democratised. It has become regionalised and gone into tier 3 and tier 4 areas,” Menon said, adding that vast spread of digital growth and its usage is driving ad spend on digital platforms. Crucial to the digital industry in India is a unified third-party measurement, Menon said. BARC is working on a digital measurement model, but it is yet to become clear when and how it will be implemented. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In FY 2018, the digital industry grew by 35 per cent, earning Rs 11,630 cr in revenues. Revenues on digital platforms are predominantly advertising driven, the report showed. “Subscription revenues in India are negligible for digital. The digital advertising revenue and subscription revenue are may be off by only 1-2 per cent. For all practical purposes, digital is advertising at the moment,” Menon said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211552_LXgT3s_Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-11.27.jpg" style="width:333px;height:710px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even though the industry has been speaking about TMT (telecom-media-technology) convergence for a while now, it is finally a reality, Menon said. “With telecom and technology players making a play on the media side and media companies realising the value that telecom and technology bring to the table, incorporating them in their distribution augurs well for the industry.” He pointed out that media companies must find alternative distribution models and not get stuck in one distribution model. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the contribution of telecom company tie-ups to OTT players, Menon said that OTT platforms are generating a significant chunk of their subscription revenues from the collaborations with telecom players. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211582_q3yV61_OTT-telecom-%281%29.jpg" style="width:450px;height:190px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the Google-Facebook duopoly continues to thrive, OTT and e-commerce platforms are increasingly attracting ad monies. “Consumer internet companies like Zomato, classifieds platforms like Quikr are seeing some traction. OTT players and e-commerce sites are beginning to emerge as favourable platforms for advertisers. News publishers in print and television are also attracting ad spend on their digital websites,” Menon said. He further said that since Google and Facebook together make up for around 70-75% of the digital ad pie, even if other platforms are attracting double the ad monies, it does not seem significant in the overall scheme of things. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even as concerns over&amp;nbsp;brand safety, viewability continue to worry brands, Menon said that he does not expect advertisers to drop spends on digital because "they cannot afford to miss the digital bus." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Almost all OTT players in India, barring exceptions like Netflix and Prime Video, follow a freemium model. Menon felt that A-VOD will continue to dominate the OTT space. “We believe that India fundamentally will be an A-VOD ad-led model and subscription model will be different from what exists globally. There will be some niche players like Netflix that are pure play S-VOD, but for the rest, telecom players will bring in the subscriptions. That is what will drive pay-models in India.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Print, which grew at 3.4 per cent over the last year raking in Rs 31,800 cr in revenues last year, underperformed in FY 2018, Menon said. “Print is probably the one sector which has felt the negative impact of digitisation because there has been incremental readers coming through on the digital side rather than on print. Also ad spend with news publishers is seeing some reallocation towards digital,” he pointed out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211779_Ee20M7_Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-11.2603.jpg" style="width:450px;height:147px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211815_I6sEfu_Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-11.2604.jpg" style="width:336px;height:480px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Radio is another area that has underperformed, Menon said. Radio grew by 7.9 per cent during FY 2018 . “The phase 3 auctions have not taken off the way they were expected. Even where operationalisation of phase 3 cities happened, the traction in terms of ad demand has not kept up as expected. That has pulled down radio performance.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211940_ux1sWL_Screen-Shot-2018-09-06-at-8.29.jpg" style="width:450px;height:114px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211970_3nywj7_Screen-Shot-2018-09-06-at-8.28.jpg" style="width:342px;height:568px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gaming&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211914_NpTbKv_Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-11.2705.jpg" style="width:337px;height:406px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536211845_dbIcpl_Screen-Shot-2018-09-05-at-11.2703.jpg" style="width:450px;height:114px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Times Network hosts India for Kerala Conclave</news:title>
      <news:description>Times Network, part of media conglomerate, The Times Group, hosted the ‘India for Kerala Conclave’ at Taj Vivanta, Thiruvananthapuram. Focused on rebuilding and rehabilitating the state with a new vision, the conclave is an on-ground extension of the #IndiaforKerala campaign initiated by the network. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inaugurated in the presence of H. E. Shri P. Sathasivam, Hon’ble Governor of Kerala, the Conclave was addressed by key decision and policy makers including Mr. Thomas Isaac, Finance Minister, Kerala, Mr. Shashi Tharoor, Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha amongst others. The Conclave also exhibited support for Kerala from various sectors including Government, Corporates and Mollywood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kerala has faced the worst calamity in over a century and the devastation is unprecedented. Rebuilding Kerala has to be a national priority, given the scale of the disaster. The state’s importance as a major tourism destination and its crucial role as a remittances hub and international links makes the action highly visible at the global level and therefore a great branding opportunity for India to showcase its resilience and indomitable national spirit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536157991_CQSvq1_Photo_1_India_For_Kerala_Conclave_Inauguration_Ceremony.jpeg" style="width:443px;height:295px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;India For Kerala Conclave Inauguration Ceremony (From R- L) H.

There were some thought provoking discussions in the sessions which included topics such as ‘Rebuilding Kerala - What Will It Take’, ‘Kerala Economy Recast - Aid or Self Reliance’, ‘Citizens for Kerala’, ‘Social Media Impact: Help &amp;amp; Hindrance’ and ‘Reimagining Kerala’. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dignitaries such as, Shibu Baby John - RSP Leader, MK Muneer - IUML Leader, V Muralidharan - MP – BJP, Prashant Nair - IAS, Oomen V Oomen - former Chairman of Kerala Biodiversity Board, Harish Vasudevan - environmental lawyer, Rahul Easwar – author &amp;amp; activist, Padma Shri G Shankar - Architect, Jose Dominic - CEO, CGH Earth, George Lamannil - Executive Director and General Counsel, Muthoot Group, Salim Yusuf - South Head Taj Hotels, Jose Joseph - Executive Vice President at Federal Bank, and well-known personalities from the entertainment industry such as, Rana Dagubatti, Resul Pookutty, Rima Kallingal, Samyukta Menon, Major Ravi, Usha Uthup expressed their views to come together to partner with the people of Kerala to rehabilitate and rebuild the lives of those devastated by rain and flood.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As the citizens of Kerala came together to help each other selflessly, the India for Kerala Conclave also acknowledged the local heroes contribution and efforts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The local heroes felicitated included Air Marshal Suresh-Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Southern Air Command, Maj Gen Sanjeev Narain-General Officer Commanding- Karnataka and Kerala Sub Area, Silvadasan Antony-Coastal Warrior, Vijay Sakhare-IPS-IG Ernakulum Range, Rajamanickam-IAS-Commissioner Food Safety along with actor Tovino Thomas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536158073_4lolbK_Photo_2_Local_Heroes_Felicitated_at_India_For_Kerala_Conclave.jpg" style="width:443px;height:295px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Local heroes felicitated at India For Kerala Conclave.

India For Kerala Conclave is an act of urgency that requires support and solidarity and this conclave is aims to find robust solutions to rebuild the lives of the people of Kerala. I’m sure through collective efforts, we will not just be able to provide succour to the affected, but also lay the foundations for a better Kerala and more importantly create a model of National cooperation and fraternity that will be the basis of a stronger India. We at Times Network pledge to keep the narrative in favour of this spirit of solidarity.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking at the event, H. E. Shri P. Sathasivam, Hon’ble Governor of Kerala said, “The floods may have rendered us weak for a while, but, our resolve was to strive and not to yield. The floods have left with many lives lost and destruction to properties. Farming sector has been washed away and the many developmental initiatives were rendered to a halt. We estimate around Rs.10,000 crore to rebuild our damaged roads and bridges. The Honourable Prime Minister had clarified to me that the Rs.600 crore released by the Centre in addition to the Rs.562.45 crore already made available in the State Disaster Response Fund of Kerala, was only the advance aid and that additional funds will be released from National Disaster Response Fund as per laid down procedure. Today, the entire world stands with us and help is pouring in to Kerala, not just from our own people, but from other governments, corporates, workers, entrepreneurs, religious institutions, media houses, celebrities and even from the piggy-banks of our little children from around the country. We are extremely grateful to all and let me assure the world that we will prove worthy of your trust by rebuilding a Kerala that the world would admire".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;T. M. Thomas Isaac, Finance Minister, Kerala, said, “The recent floods have created a frank open discussion in rethinking of the past developments and what could be done jointly in the present. We are thinking about a new edition of ‘Kerala Model’ of development. In our old edition, we have been successful in redistribution process so that everybody gets minimum quality life. If it was expected Rs 60,000 to 70,000 crores for these developments, now an addition of Rs 30,000 crore to this has become the need of the hour in expanding and re-building roads and infrastructure after the floods. The other concern is the damage the floods been done to the traditional industries of the state like Chendamangalam weaving and to Aranmula Mirror. Their living ways were destroyed and it is a concern of how to rebuild their lives as well”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536158068_MMoUWT_Photo_3_Rebuilding_Kerala_What_Will_It_Take_Panel.jpg" style="width:443px;height:295px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rebuilding Kerala What Will It Take Panel (From L -R) Vivek Narayan - Executive Editor, TIMES NOW, V Muralidharan, MP- BJP, T.M Thomas Isaac – Finance Minister, Kerala, M.K Muneer – Leader IUML, Shibhu Baby John – Leader RSP and Manoj Das, Editor- Kerala, The Times of India &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the event, Arun Jaitley, Union Finance Minister said, “My compliments go to the civil society of Kerala which has shown exemplary attitude in helping each other this hours of crisis. Armed Forces have done a tremendous job in the rescue operations. Now the process of providing flood relief is substantial work in progress. All agencies from Central Government are there to fully assist the state of Kerala in trying of rehabilitate the people of Kerala better than what they had earlier. I have asked the insurance companies to settle the claims, the banks to give loans so that people can get a breathing space in rebuilding life. Further aid from the Central Government will be given once the full estimate of the damage is done. I am sure we will see the quality life for the Keralites reinstated.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pinarayi Vijayan, Chief Minister of Kerala said, “Our focus for Kerala is two-pronged. While carrying out relief activities, we are also focusing on the emergence of a new Kerala. Through India for Kerala Conclave, I take this opportunity to make an appeal to each and every one of you to partner with the people of Kerala to rehabilitate and rebuild the lives of those devastated by rain and flood. I hope through this association with Times Network, the message will be conveyed acSabha India For Kerala Conclave (From L-R) Shashi Tharoor, Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha and Faye D'Souza Executive Editor &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shashi Tharoor, Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha, said, “People of the state of Kerala beyond caste, religion, and politics came together during the flood operation. The youngsters did commendable work in spreading the word on getting help both on social media and on-ground. On the UAE aid controversy, I would like to clarify that there are far richer countries than India, which have accepted such aids. Even there is a written policy by the Narendra Modi government in 2016, which states that we can accept the aid offered by a foreign country but may not appeal for it. Kerala needs more financial support and more help in rebuilding the state. Kerala should consider the Bhuj Model of hosting a Rebuild Kerala Conference to bring in money and help in grands, loan or charity in helping the state. During the earthquakes in Bhuj 2001, Gujarat could raise Rs 1.7 billion partly in loan and grand for helping the state. But for that we need a credible assessment and hence I suggest, we seek help from the international agencies like UN in studying the destruction caused and based on it we can arrange conclaves in creating a new Kerala.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536158063_gnvdkJ_Photo_4_India_For_Kerala_Conclave_%28From_L-R%29_Shashi_Tharoor%2C_Member_of_Parliament%2C_Lok_Sabha_and_Faye_D%27Souza_Executive_Editor.jpg" style="width:443px;height:295px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;India For Kerala Conclave (From L-R) Shashi Tharoor, Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha and Faye D'Souza Executive Editor &lt;br&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;Times Network urges individuals and companies to come forward to join the campaign #IndiaforKerala to help their fellow Indians to rehabilitate, resettle and re-build Kerala to its glory. Continuing with its efforts, citizens can donate funds in form of cheques, in favour of “Times Foundation” to Times Foundation, 10, Daryaganj, New Delhi – 110002 or NEFT/RTGS. The collected amount will be donated to the Kerala CM’s Distress Relief Fund.

      <news:title>We are evaluating manufacturing in India: CEO, Skechers South Asia Pvt. Ltd</news:title>
      <news:description>American performance and lifestyle footwear brand Skechers has announced the first edition of Skechers Performance Mumbai Walkathon. The consumer engagement initiative by Skechers India, will take place on World Walking Day (October 7) to educate people about the benefits of walking. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brand is targeting to become an Rs 1,000 crore brand in the next five years in India and has been ramping up its presence by constantly expanding their portfolio to further up their omni-channel presence. Rahul Vira, Chief Executive Office, Skechers South Asia Pvt. Ltd in an exclusive interview with exchange4media spoke about major areas the brand is investing in, the challenges that come with manufacturing and consumer behavioural trends that Skechers is tapping onto. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Below are the edited excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why the Walkathon? How does the brand benefit from such properties?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since we created this category of walking/ footwear, we realised that while everyone does marathon, none do a 'Walkathon'. As a brand since we have created this category and hold a leadership position, we thought to ourselves that we should create a platform for people to come and walk together. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a lot of positive rub-off with these properties. And there are a lot of latent things happening with consumers, so while we are connecting directly and talking to them directly, these things do help with creating that engagement indirectly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve recently started your own portal. Tell us about how getting to omni-channel has panned out for the brand?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our online portal is just at the beginning stage. It will take a while for us to put things together. Here there are many parameters to put together. At the end of the day if a consumer is not getting a seamless experience, all this doesn’t mean anything. The idea is whenever we go out, we ensure a seamless experience for the consumer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on manufacturing in India? Do you think of it as a challenge?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would not say that it is a challenge. It is just that in our scheme of things, we have been evaluating looking at manufacturing in India. It’s just that in the initial stages we were small because we had just started off. I think that over a period of time, we would definitely look making it work in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Skechers’ year-on-year India growth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I would just say it is crazy double-digit growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much does e-commerce contribute to your sales?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;It contributes to 5 per cent of our sales.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the consumer behavioural trends that Skechers is seeing? And how is it being used for your brand-building?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;From a consumer trend perspective, there are certain global trends that Indian consumers are looking at. One of the interesting things that we realised is Indian consumers have started looking at footwear in a more research manner. They have started thinking that for walking they need a different shoe, for running they need a different shoe. There is a lot of information that consumers have imbibed and we have seen it in the spends and preferences whenever they have come to purchase. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any plans in terms of further expanding your product portfolio?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here we have shoes, apparels, accessories, shoe care and whole lot of stuff happening.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the major areas the brand is investing in?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br&gt;We’re investing in creating these properties like Walkathon. There is a lot of consumer-engagement activities that we’re doing. In the running category, we conducted an activation. For fashion, there is another property we are looking at. I think that across all the spaces, we’re looking at creating properties to engage the consumers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading advertisers are taking digital media buying in-house. What are your thoughts on this? Is this sustainable? If yes, will Skechers adopt this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have agencies on-board to help us through it because as a company, I would rather focus my energies on the brand-building part of it. There are experts who understand this and we would rely on them cause of their domain expertise. For us, it’s more of the outsource part of it. Agencies help us with it.</news:description>

      <news:title>By 2022, 9 in 10 airline &amp; hotel bookings will be mobile-influenced: Facebook-KPMG Report</news:title>
      <news:description>Facebook on Wednesday released the fourth research report under its programme called Zero Friction Future, this time for the Indian travel industry. Authored by KPMG in India and based on the primary research and insights from a survey conducted by Nielsen, the report is titled ‘Eliminating friction in travel path to purchase’. It defines frictions at each stage of the travel purchase journey and highlights the significant role mobile and Facebook can play to influence Indian travelers' purchase journeys.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The report suggests that nearly half of the total consumer loss in airline ticket purchases (11 per cent out of 23 per cent) and hotel bookings (16 per cent out of 32 per cent), is on account of media friction. It reveals that by 2022, around 9 in 10 airline ticket purchases and hotel bookings will be mobile-influenced, creating a USD 19 billion and USD 12 billion sales opportunity for airline and hotel brands, respectively. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Additionally, the report reveals that mobile-influenced journeys for airline ticket purchases are 24 per cent shorter and for hotel bookings are 19 per cent shorter than offline-influenced journeys. In fact, mobile can help airline brands and hotel brands tap into a potential sales opportunity of USD9 billion and USD 2 billion by reducing media friction.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Speaking on the launch of the report, Pulkit Trivedi, Director, Facebook India, said, “Today, mobile plays a significant role in most travel purchases, making it imperative for brands to optimise their media mix and explore different marketing pathways. At Facebook, we want to help brands convert better by connecting better with their consumers. Our latest report aims at assisting travel brands and marketers in designing relevant mobile marketing strategies, which can help them reduce friction in consumers' path to purchase and consequently increase sales.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As per the findings of the report, mobile can help reduce consumer friction and aid increased conversion for travel brands at a lower cost. In the airline category, increased role of mobile in media mix can help increase 2pp of purchase conversion totaling to USD 9 billion sales opportunity for brands by 2022, at 30 per cent lower cost of acquisition. In the hotel category, mobile can help increase 3pp of purchase conversion totaling to USD 2 billion sales opportunity for brands by 2022, at 15 per cent lower cost of acquisition.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the report findings, Arvind Gupta, Head – Management Consulting, KPMG in India said, “Engagement and the way of consuming digital today is redefining the way in which consumers are making travel choices. In today’s competitive environment, travelers expect a near identical experience from one device to the other, from one website to a mobile app and from a travel brochure to the destination. This is why it has become critical for brands to engage with travelers with one comprehensive message and all the information they expect, in a timely fashion.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Any disruption in the journey impacts the purchase decision of the traveler. It is important to understand what leads to dropouts in the path to purchase of travel essentials like airline tickets, hotel bookings etc., known more popularly as friction. The report/ study aims to understand this very aspect and stages of purchase journey in the travel path and also elucidates on the possible means to eliminate friction and improve conversion rates in the travel space,” he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ashish Karnad, Executive Director, Marketing Effectiveness, Nielsen India, said, “The study was conducted with the intent of measuring the influence and impact of individual media touch-points on the consumers' path to purchase route – right from their need identification of booking an airline ticket or making a reservation in a hotel, to finally completing said reservation. Given the dynamic nature of the travel category with a vast presence of aggregators and existing online presence of all prominent players in the marketplace, it was imperative to better understand the current interactions of consumers with both online and offline touch points. As intuited, mobile has increasingly become a prominent presence in the consumers’ journey across stages. Mobile being ones preferred medium for interacting with the category, enhancing mobile's role in the media mix not only gives marketers the opportunity to offer their consumers a seamless purchase journey but also gives them the opportunity to capitalize on the enhanced earning potential.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We hope this study will give advertisers and consumers alike the current category landscape while also providing a bird's eye view on the possible opportunities being missed by marketers due to media friction and bring in further optimization.” he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to the research, the top friction areas for different demographic cohorts vary and hence marketers need to customise their marketing strategy accordingly. Some key consumer friction areas across touch points include:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•  &lt;strong&gt;Gender:&lt;/strong&gt; In airline ticket purchases, nearly 70 per cent of men are impacted by the friction at the top of the funnel leading to dropouts early in the purchase journey. Most men believe that offer communication shared by the brands are either not clear or don’t capture sufficient details. Women, on the other hand, seek more information and assistance with the purchase as they are likely to ignore advertisements on offline mediums such as print and radio. Whereas, in hotel bookings, lack of ‘relevant ads’ and ‘clear call to action’ are top friction areas for both men and women at the top of the funnel. In fact, over 70 per cent of men drop out due to these friction areas at the awareness stage itself. Towards the end of the purchase journey, men expect more relevant information and leave the purchase funnel as they find it difficult to express interest in the property of their choice. While, most women exit the purchase cycle at the last leg due to lack of credible advice, not enough information, unclear payment terms and offer communication.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•  &lt;strong&gt;Age:&lt;/strong&gt; For airline ticket purchases, clear offer communication, emerges as the common ask for all groups. Although airline advertising is often targeted towards older age groups, a similar number of potential consumers in 18–24 years old also enter and complete the purchase journey. Young prospective travelers (18-24 years old) are a lucrative customer segment and are characterised by their familiarity with new technologies. Nearly half of the aware decision makers in 18-24 years old are lost early in the purchase cycle as they are not guided to the next stage. For hotel bookings, a significant proportion of visitors on travel portals seeking information on hotels and resorts are from 18-24 years old age group. This age group travels more often and seeks more information throughout the travel purchase journey. Nearly a fourth of the aware decision makers dropout at last leg of the purchase journey due to trust issues or a lack of transparency in package/costing details. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;•  &lt;strong&gt;Socio-economic: &lt;/strong&gt;For the airline category, while friction points faced by NCCS A and NCCS B consumers such as the need for assistance during the purchase journey, clear communication of relevant information and offers, were similar across the purchase journey, an NCCS B consumer considered unavailability of payment options and schemes as a major friction point while moving from awareness stage to consideration stage. NCCS A consumers on the other hand dropout due to information gaps at consideration and intent stage on issues such as offer communication, difficulty in browsing information, lack of relevant information, etc. Similarly, for hotels category, nearly half of NCCS A consumers are lost at the top of the funnel as they fail to find clear and requisite information on relevant media. NCCS B consumers require adequate purchase assistance across the stages as they face issues related to unclear offers, guidance to move to next stage, more clarity on payment schemes and options, etc.</news:description>

      <news:title>Sunfeast Mom’s Magic and Ogilvy Bangalore create a campaign for Teacher’s Day</news:title>
      <news:description>Sunfeast Mom’s Magic, the biscuit brand from the ITC Sunfeast Portfolio was launched in 2014. The range of Sunfeast Mom’s Magic cookies are positioned as a platform to savour relationships while having a strong focus on the mother-child relationship throughout its brand history. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advertisments for the brand in the past have focused on delightful moments between mother and child, or the instances where children most reminisce the magic their moms provide in their lives. As the brand moved forward witnessing the positioning strike a chord with its audience, it then widened its platform to celebrate the ‘mom in each one of us’ – a space that opened up new conversations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the occasion of Teachers Day, Sunfeast Mom’s Magic picked up a wonderful insight on how one’s teachers have also played the role of a mother to many.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The beauty of this film lies in the simplicity of the idea. A loving and caring teacher is the closest one can get to a mother's love and affection. The film_ drives home this simple thought through an understated but magical bond between a class teacher and one of her little students. It's real and nuanced, never tries too hard to deliver a message. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about the campaign Mahesh Gharat, CCO South, Ogilvy said, There was such a simple but beautiful insight in the film that we wanted to tell the story in as simple a narrative as possible. We wanted to keep it real and focus on the nuances. Even the actors were free to improvise and interpret their parts and they did that with aplomb. I have always believed that magic happens only if you keep it real.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Ola launches a new campaign for Ola Rentals featuring Sumeet Vyas</news:title>
      <news:description>Ola, the ride-sharing platform, has launched a nationwide, integrated campaign focusing on Ola Rentals. Starring actor and writer Sumeet Vyas, the video campaign highlights Ola Rentals as your ‘go-to’ weekend ride. With the ease of booking a cab that remains at a customer’s disposal, waiting on them, as they move from place to place, Ola Rentals has emerged as a convenient, hassle-free solution which fills in for your personal car!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Conceptualised and developed by Happy mcgarrybowen, the creative agency from Dentsu Aegis Network, the TVCs show Sumeet as an empowered Ola Rentals customer who isn’t worried about&amp;nbsp;getting tired of driving for long hours in heavy traffic. Instead, he enjoys a day out with his wife and back-to-back outings to meet relatives since he gets to relax in the backseat like a boss. The catch phrase #NoStressBoss, used by the central character of the film, plays upon the idea of enjoying the comfort Ola Rentals provides to its customers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Actor and writer, Sumeet Vyas said, “I completely related to the concept of the films. As a professional who works round the clock almost every day of the week, I look forward to stress free weekends with my family and friends. A product like Ola Rentals can give you that much required relief that commuters are looking for! One doesn’t have to fret about driving in crazy traffic, looking for parking spots endlessly, etc. I am so looking forward to use Rentals by Ola next time when I have to go for a shopping spree or need to run errands all around the city.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pallav Singh, Senior Vice President at Ola said, “Since its launch in 2016, Ola Rentals has been a favourite among corporate customers and working executives who move from one meeting to another during the day. Through this latest campaign we want to highlight the convenience of having a cab on disposal for diverse needs like shopping trips, meeting friends, visiting relatives, local sightseeing etc. I am glad to share that the TVCs are garnering great response, which goes to show that customers today value convenience and experience. They don’t want to tire themselves driving in heavy traffic, instead would like to be driven around as they relax and enjoy their day off."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samarjit Choudhry, Chief Operating Officer, Happy mcgarrybowen said, “Ola Rentals is a very unique category. Unlike a pointto-point cab, this one is meant to take you to multiple places. It takes away a lot of pain points like parking or having to book another cab, not to say the pain of driving on congested roads. Keeping all this in mind, we decided to take weekends as a plank for communication because a large number of the people get out on weekends and face the stress of weekend traffic and finding parking spots. The ease of the product offering had to be conveyed and hence we came up with the campaign thought of #NoStressBoss.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The TVCs are being showcased through digital, video, social, OOH and radio; and have already garnered more than 5.8 million impressions on various digital platforms. So far, both 30 second videos have collectively garnered 1.2 million+ views on YouTube..&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One of Ola’s fastest growing categories, Ola Rentals is available in 95+ cities and has completed 5 million rides across the country. Launched in 2016, the category offers intra-city travel with affordable hourly packages (starting 1 hr onwards), making running multiple errands within a single day in different locations extremely convenient and hassle-free. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the campaign&amp;nbsp;videos here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Orient Electric’s latest ad has Dhoni urging people to switch to BEE 5-Star rated bulbs </news:title>
      <news:description>Orient Electric has launched an integrated advertising campaign featuring cricketer MS Dhoni to promote its BEE 5-star rated LED bulbs. The TV ad urges people to switch to ‘India’s first BEE 5-star rated LED bulbs’ for better light output and even more energy savings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anshuman Chakravarty, Head Brand &amp;amp; Corporate Communication, Orient Electric Limited said, “We were the first Indian brand to receive BEE 3-star rating in 2016 for our LED bulbs and once again, we are the first to have voluntarily adopted BEE 5-star rating. The campaign tries to increase awareness about the benefits of switching to BEE 5-star rated LED bulbs which deliver 120 lumens per watt and are 30 per cent brighter than BEE 3-star rated bulbs.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“The new TV commercial urges people in a thought-provoking way to switch ‘Haq Se’ to Orient’s highly efficient 5-star rated bulbs. MS Dhoni has a longstanding association with us and therefore he was our natural choice for this campaign.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign has been conceptualised by Contract Advertising. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mayur Hola, EVP and ECD, Contract Advertising, Delhi, said, “Orient Electric has emerged as a brand leader as well as a thought leader in the LED lighting category. In the cluttered lighting category most conversations revolve around cost savings and energy efficiency. Orient’s differentiator is that their LED bulbs are 5-star rated and brighter at a time when other brands only really meet the government’s 3-star mandate. So, we decided to deposition 3-star rated LED bulbs by labelling them ordinary. Light-hearted and clear, the messaging drives this home with a tongue in cheek song accompanying it.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The TV ad is strongly flanked by print advertisement and active engagement through digital touch points. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VHc5Gj_Lp_I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>CLA's Sajan Raj Kurup &amp; ad man Prahlad Kakkar launch Dining Table for SMEs and FOBs</news:title>
      <news:description>Creativeland Asia’s Sajan Raj Kurup (Founder and Creative Chairman), and Prahlad Kakkar (Chief Mentor) have launched ‘Dining Table’, a marketing, communications and business consultancy for family-owned and small to medium-sized business owners.  &lt;br&gt;Founded by Kurup, Dining Table salutes the spirit of entrepreneurship, recognising and understanding the challenges that come with owning a business.&lt;br&gt;The current number of SMEs in India is estimated to be 42.50 million, and is said to employ about 106 million, that is a staggering 40% of India’s workforce, next only to the agricultural sector.   &lt;br&gt;Speaking on the launch, Sajan Raj Kurup, Founder &amp;amp; Creative Chairman, Creativeland Asia Group, said, “In my personal experience, I have seen most SMEs and Indian Family owned businesses struggle a lot trying to navigate the creative and media agency models that exist today. Leading to an environment of mistrust, doubt and mismatched expectations. These businesses finally end up roping in trusted individuals to navigate the confusing world of marketing communications and media based more on their comfort rather than their competency. The Dining Table is designed to become perfect balance of competency and comfort for these business owners. The Dining Table will customise and aggregate everything an SME/Family Owned Business needs. The idea is to first create solidarity and trust, where the darndest questions can be asked without the intimidation of a boardroom. Then arrive at tailor-made solutions that the business needs in the most cost-effective manner. This is a place of comfort, a place for friends and family, and a place where crucial decisions are taken. Hence, we have curated a space, wherein there is no need for complex words, egos or formalities. From finding the right agency fit, arriving at right research methodology, restructuring marketing departments, choosing the right business consultants, to a complete design refresh, IP creations, Dining Table will be a business owner’s go-to place to find exactly the right fit or all their marketing, communications and brand transformation needs.” &lt;br&gt; “Having been a part of numerous success stories and written a few ourselves we understand that, some of the biggest success stories in the country don’t emerge out of boardrooms, but are built on dining tables instead. I started Creativeland from a Dining Table too and even today every single board meeting happens on the dining table, over some great food,” added Kurup. &lt;br&gt;Speaking on the launch, Prahlad Kakkar, Chief Mentor for Dining Table and the chairman of India SME Forum, said, “When Raj discussed the concept with me, I jumped at it and I’m excited to kick start this unit with him. Dining Table Creative Services is a great refreshing concept and exactly what business owners require today. I have been closely involved with SMEs for the last 10 years and I am also the chairman of the SME forum in India. Having spent bulk of my time consulting and convincing them on the value of brand creation, I have realised that most of them are very savvy business owners but are uncomfortable about investing in building brands because they think it is going to cost a lot. Dining Table is the just the right place for them to get exposed to more cost-effective ways, discover newer brand building models and meet the experts of their choice and talk business in the language they are most comfortable in. And all this over my greatest passion, food!”&lt;br&gt;The Dining Table will be both asset light and Modular and will have experts and a roster of creative and media and other marketing communications agencies with specific skill-sets mapped out.</news:description>

      <news:title>Happy mcgarrybowen bags Foodpanda’s creative duties</news:title>
      <news:description>Following a multi-agency pitch process and numerous rounds of evaluation, online food delivery marketplace Foodpanda has awarded its creative mandate to Dentsu Aegis Network’s creative agency Happy mcgarrybowen. Foodpanda was acquired by Ola Cabs in December last year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pitch for the creative mandate included both advertising and design disciplines, as the start-up looks to revamp its identity after the alignment with Ola. After a tight race, both the design and the brand communications mandates were awarded to Happy mcgarrybowen, which in the past has helped carve a niche for flagship startups like Flipkart, Myntra and Ola.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the move, Bhavish Aggarwal, CEO, Ola Cabs, said, “At Foodpanda, our mission is to connect deeper with our love and passion for food, and build not just a great delivery experience but also a great food experience. We trust that Happy mcgarrybowen would be able to take that narrative and ethos to the world with strong design and visual communication capabilities.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anshul Khandelwal, Head of Marketing- Foodpanda, said, “We distinctly understand the need to build a strong and differentiated brand that people love. Being a food experience platform, we intend to constantly innovate to build foodie-first solutions for India. Considering Happy Mcgarrybowen’s work portfolio, we are confident that the association will ensure an effective brand strategy and communications.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy mcgarrybowen has been tasked with re-thinking the brand's design language, which includes reinterpreting its logo and visual identity for the present-day. The advertising and communications will follow suit to help the brand form a bond with consumers in this ever-changing world of transactional relationships.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On winning the business, Kartik Iyer, CEO, Happy mcgarrybowen, said, “In a time where the market has already been created, we are proud to have won the mandates in such a competitive environment. We're raring to go and leap ahead with Foodpanda right to the top.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PM Praveen Das, CCO, Happy mcgarrybowen, added, “‘Today brands are ubiquitously present on the digital media, therefore corporate identity too has evolved into a dynamic form. This is the age of the animated logos, GIFs, sonic signatures, design thinking and so on. We are very excited to work on evolving the Foodpanda brand identity by giving it an emergent, contemporary twist and bring it alive to a youthful audience who is so much into food these days.”</news:description>

      <news:title>Arushi Sharma to head Brand Partnerships &amp; Strategy for Chtrbox </news:title>
      <news:description>Chtrbox, an Influencer Marketing company, has appointed Arushi Sharma as the Head of Brand Partnerships &amp;amp; Strategy for Mumbai. In her new role, Sharma will be responsible for steering the growth of the firm’s specialized Influencer Marketing business in Mumbai, while also contributing towards team and culture building and product innovation. She will also work towards setting newer benchmarks for how strategically and creatively can social media influencers be leveraged for brands and agencies in India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She has over eight years of experience across the UK, Singapore, Indonesia and India. Most recently, she was leading the social media team, including the influencer marketing division, for Iris Worldwide in Indonesia, and was previously with them in Singapore where she led the APAC Digital Command Centre for Philips. Among her many achievements, the highlights of her career have been winning the Bronze Social Campaign of the Year Award for Philips as well as being invited to speak at the Cannes Lions Festival 2016 held in France. She also managed the PR &amp;amp; digital launch of Spotify across South East Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about her association with Chtrbox, Sharma said, "In my experience across markets and sectors, the one thing that I have increasingly witnessed is the demand for authentic voices and storytelling in the social media space. It is exciting to work with a brilliant up-and-coming platform like Chtrbox that addresses the lack of consolidation on pricing and strong measurement models to give popular and emerging brands and influencers an effective and measurable way of partnering together. Together with this dynamic team, we are changing the way this space operates, and are excited to do more.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; On Arushi’s appointment, Pranay Swarup, Co-Founder &amp;amp; CEO @Chatterbox, said: “Arushi and I had connected almost a decade ago as colleagues. We've witnessed each other grow as professionals over the years, and I'm glad that we're now doing some disruptive work together. With Arushi's experiences across international markets, and the clientele and scale of work that she has managed, we are certain that she would provide newer avenues for Chtrbox to grow.  I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Arushi again and wish her a successful and fruitful journey with us.”</news:description>

      <news:title>Sports is in the DNA of TATA Group: Vivek Srivatsa, Tata Motors</news:title>
      <news:description>The countdown to Asia Cup has begun. There is a good prospect of arch rivals India and Pakistan taking on one another, an opportunity for brands to garner the maximum eyeballs. Vivek Srivatsa, Marketing Head, Passenger Vehicle Business Unit, Tata Motors, gets talking to us on how brands can leverage such intense cricket tournaments to its maximum effect:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How impactful is cricket as a vehicle for brand building?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It is a known fact that cricket arguably attracts the most eyeballs in India as well as from the Indian diaspora spread across the world. Right from the ad breaks between the overs and after the fall of wickets to different forms of marketing inventory associated with it, the sport across all its formats naturally lends itself to aspects such as optimising ad spots, ensuring advertising efficiency, raising the brand profile and staying relevant in a highly competitive marketplace. This gives associating brands assured visibility and return on investment (ROI). Moreover, tournaments like IPL and World Cup or even the imminent Asia Cup bring brands and advertisers together and cut through geographical boundaries to reach the target audience, making such properties one of the most sought after events in the marketing calendar of brands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can brands leverage intense cricket tournaments to its maximum?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;In today’s day and age, garnering a mere spot in one medium is not sufficient enough. The arrival of digital, ignition of moment marketing, and need for creating experiences have compelled marketers to look beyond the vanilla techniques. It is more about customising and engaging; it is more about creating an experience for consumers that compels them to engage and add the product to their basket. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take us through some of your recent cricket-based campaigns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Sports has been in the DNA of Tata Group. This year saw Tata Nexon become the official partners for the prestigious IPL, one of the biggest sporting events in the country. The association, which is for next three years, has and will help us derive great synergies using this platform to provide a unique and differentiated experience to our customers. To leverage this platform, we executed various initiatives for&amp;nbsp;capturing the audience’s attention on-ground, on-air and across digital. We also went multi-lingual with our communication. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What kind of ROI has Tata Motors seen from its various cricket-based campaigns? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The IPL association led to an increase in the leads and bookings for Nexon during the months of April and May, the duration of the tournament. Between April 6 and May 27, 2018, lead generation of Nexon went up by 98%. We also witnessed an increase of 18 per cent in leads and bookings for its other models during the month of May, traditionally considered a weak month in the industry for passenger car sales. Owing to the demand for Nexon and Hexa SUVs, our domestic sales registered an impressive growth of 63 per cent year-on-year.</news:description>

      <news:title>Amer Jaleel, Virat Tandon promoted at MullenLowe Lintas Group</news:title>
      <news:description>MullenLowe Lintas Group has made two significant elevations in India. Amer Jaleel has been named Group Chairman and Chief Creative Officer while Virat Tandon has been named Group CEO. In their new roles, the duo will lead the group mandate in India overseeing its three agencies; Lowe Lintas, Mullen Lintas and PointNine Lintas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of the new Group leadership, Alex Leikikh – global CEO, MullenLowe Group, said, “A few years ago, we had asked Amer and Virat to start our second agency in India, Mullen Lintas, and they have built it into a top 10 agency in the country in just two years. Amer has been a creative leader of our group in India for a very long time now, and Virat embodies the entrepreneurial spirit of the MullenLowe Group. I am delighted to have them steer our overall business in India to even greater success.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of their new roles, Jaleel and Tandon jointly said, “We have a lot of strong assets in the group. Two top ten agencies, Lowe Lintas and Mullen Lintas; a very promising incubation, the Omni-channel agency PointNine Lintas; some of the industry’s best and brightest creative, strategy and business leaders; and last but not the least, a culture that makes us stick together and tick. The future is looking different and exciting. There could be no better time for the group to embark on this journey. To stay at the top of its game, MullenLowe Lintas Group realizes the importance of investing in building a strong talent pool with new skills that are relevant in the digital and hyper-connected world. It’s becoming more challenging for brands to win in the marketplace as the consumer is evolving and most categories are being disrupted and transformed due to technology. Clients are looking for all the help they can get from their agencies to win in this new reality. We want to continue to be our clients’ biggest strength.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a separate development, Arun Iyer – Chairman and CCO of Lowe Lintas, has decided to move within the agency to become a creative consultant. He plans to start a venture of his own and will transition out of the agency over the next year. The agency has planned a twelve-month transition period, during which he will continue to work for some key clients and help with succession planning.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iyer said, “I have had the privilege of being part of an institution. I have spent a little over 15 years here. And it is home. Over the last few years, I have been passionate about start-ups and have played a role in developing some strong brands such as Byju’s, Freecharge and Grofers. Going forward, I am planning to work more closely within the start-up eco-system.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaleel added, “Arun and I have been brothers-in-arms for over eight years now. We’ve been shouldering the equity and reputation of Lintas together. Arun has, over the last three years, taken the spirit that Balki infused in Lowe Lintas to a different zone and moulded the agency in his own way. A large part of my job for MullenLowe Lintas Group will be to take that imprint forward.”&lt;br&gt;Amer Jaleel joined Lowe Lintas in 2002 and has held multiple creative leadership positions including Chief Creative Officer. Virat Tandon joined the group in 2004 in the New Delhi offices of Lowe Lintas and has since played various senior roles in the network in India and Singapore. When the group started Mullen Lintas in 2015, it named Jaleel and Tandon as Chairman and CCO, and CEO respectively. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaleel and Tandon’s elevations are effective immediately.</news:description>

      <news:title>I'd be a fighter pilot in an alternate life: Sam Singh, CEO, GroupM South Asia</news:title>
      <news:description>An alumnus of IIM Calcutta, Sameer Singh was appointed the CEO of GroupM’s South Asia operations in July this year. Sam Singh - as he is popularly known in the industry joined GroupM from Google India where he was the Director-Sales. Currently based in Gurugram (Delhi), Singh leads the brands’ data-centric solutions, digital solutions and content services for clients in South Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a fireside chat, Singh tells us that media agencies are at that wonderful intersection for brands, consumers, media and technology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEYOND MY LINKEDIN PROFILE…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I come from an armed forces family, that’s where I learnt the value of discipline. As a kid, we used to relocate a lot; that gave me the wonderful opportunity to live in different parts of the country and learn about the diversity of our cultural heritage. In my work life, I’ve had the opportunity to live across places such as the Silicon Valley, Boston, London, Dubai, Guangzhou and of course, India; this gave me the chance to work and live with people across varied cultures and to appreciate diversity. Other than that, I’m passionate about riding fast motorcycles on fast roads – recently, I went on a motorcycling trip in the Alps…absolutely stunning!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HOW I JOINED THE MEDIA AGENCY BUSINESS…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Media agencies are at that wonderful intersection for brands, consumers, media and technology. Agencies are a vibrant environment with dynamic people. I love working here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FACING A CHALLENGE, LEARNING FROM IT…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each time that I deliberately made a functional move, it took me off the linear track to success. However, I’ve gained such a varied and wonderful set of experiences which really power me in my work today. I’ve worked across varied functions such as advertising, media management, brand management, digital, sales, research, forecasting and procurement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MY TOP PRIORITIES…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Learn the business. Contribute to growth for our clients. Focus on training and enablement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT I HOPE TO BRING TO THE INDUSTRY…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having spent so much time on the client side, I would say ‘having a client first view’ is something I bring to the table. A ‘digital appropriate’ viewpoint because of my Google experience. Also ‘multi-cultural and global experience’ owing to my work experience in various countries with global firms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IF NOT IN THE AD-MEDIA INDUSTRY, I’D BE…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A fighter pilot in an alternate life!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;To read more log in to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.impactonnet.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.impactonnet.com/&lt;/a&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>SC to decide fate of broadcasters on TRAI tariff order today</news:title>
      <news:description>The Supreme Court will on Wednesday hear a petition against TRAI tariff and inter-connect order. The hearing was deffered on August 28, 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On July 3, 2018, TRAI had implemented the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable) Interconnection (Addressable Systems) Regulations 2017 after it was upheld by the Madras High Court with an exception. While bringing the order into effect on July 3, the TRAI had prescribed timelines for the stakeholders. The deadline for compliance was August 31, 2018.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following the deadline, most of the major broadcasters have published their Reference Interconnect Offer (RIO) along with the Interconnection Agreement.&amp;nbsp;Big broadcasters, including Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited, Sony Pictures Networks India Private Limited and TV18 Broadcast Limited, have declared their RIOs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This RIO shall be effective for the term commencing from 29-December-2018 (i.e., at the end of 180 days from the date of TRAI’s press release dated 3-July-2018, read with TRAI’s notifications dated 3-March-2017),” reads the RIO published by TV18 Broadcast Ltd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, Zee, in line with the tariff order, announced “multiple bouquets catering to consumers of different languages across India. All Zee channels will be available on a-la-carte basis, as required by the Regulations. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Star India, which is one of the petitioners against TRAI tariff and interconnect order, is yet to file its RIO.</news:description>

As technology levels the playing field for the marketing haves and have-nots, content is the only game changer for a company in achieving its marketing and business objectives. In a world, where digital is breaking silos, content is mission critical for organisations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536118091_s31uBn_content-jam-logo.jpg" style="width:350px;height:193px;float:right"&gt;&lt;br&gt;This year the event is slated to have more than 100 agencies and brands participating and will witness 500+ attendees. The full-day conference will have keynote sessions by Indian &amp;amp; global speakers, panel discussions with content creators and platform owners, and speaker sessions by top brands followed by the awards night that makes up for high brand visibility and great networking opportunities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A total of three Panel Discussions and a Celebrity Chat are to be held. The first panel discussion chaired by Arnab Mitra, Managing Director, Liqvd Asia World Wide will cover the topic ‘Creating Sustainable Content Play Content’. It will discuss how the consumption habits have very clearly moved to social and OTT &amp;amp; Digital platforms, not only for the millennial but for a large portion of connected consumers. Will original content continue to be a differentiator and drive growth for OTT &amp;amp; Digital Platforms? Is the Potential for Indian subscribers paying for premium content not too far from reality? Have the OTT &amp;amp; Digital Platforms decoded what will keep them relevant and in business in the long term? Speakers involved at this session are Manish Aggarwal, Business Head, Zee5 India and Akash Banerji, Head- Marketing &amp;amp; Partnerships, Viacom18 Digital Ventures – Voot.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The second Panel Discussion chaired by Samir Bangara, Founder &amp;amp; MD, Qyuki Digital Media will feature a talk about ‘Content Intelligence Injecting Science into Content Creation’. It will answer questions such as are content creators and brand owners relying on digital, data and technology as an ally? Have newer forms of tech allowed in generating insights that can guide in content creation, which otherwise tends to be about gut feel and intuition? Is the foundation on which content planning and creation done bolstered enough to produce new content solutions that will deliver results? What should the role of technology be for content creators and for brand owners? Is the role of creativity augmented or compromised? What are the challenges ahead? The speakers for this discussion are Kanika Mohan Saxena, VP - Content Services, Vodafone India; Bhuvan Bam, Youtuber - Singer - Song Writer; Arun Unni, Chief Content Officer, TataSky; Karthik Nagarajan, Chief Content Officer, Wavemaker; Ajay Nair, Director, Only Much Louder (OML); and Amit Gilani, Executive Creative Director, The Viral Fever (TVF).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The third Panel Discussion will cover the topic 'From Content Silos to Content Ecosystems'. The topic will discuss how unlike legacy media a brand knew where, what, when and how its content would be seen, today brands are dependent on media scenarios that include multiple variables before any form of content is shown to a particular consumer. How are brands changing from focusing on self to monitoring and preparing for the big picture of where their content will be seen? How should brands identify, partner and collaborate with other ecosystem players to ensure that their content makes maximum impact, in a desired way? Is brand safety still a concern on digital platforms in India? What are the expectations thereof? Speakers involved in this session are Prachi Mohapatra, Chief Marketing Officer, FBB; Sudhanshu Nagpal, Head-Biscuits Category, Mondelez India; Sachin Killawala, Marketing Director, Nivea India; Amitabh Pande, Deputy Marketing Manager, IKEA India; and Zoya Pandey, Head-Marketing Excellence, Abbott Healthcare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last panel discussion is a Celebrity Chat, which will be chaired by Annurag Batra, Chairman &amp;amp; Editor-In-Chief, exchange4media on the topic of 'Content Marketing Lessons from Entertainment Industry'.

      <news:title>Mark Read's Investor Meet: Streamlining, no playing catch-up with tech giants in focus</news:title>
      <news:description>WPP released its half-yearly results on September 4. Newly appointed CEO Mark Read&amp;nbsp;head on  tackled&amp;nbsp;the questions raised about WPP over the last five months in his first investor meeting. “People said, can WPP return to growth, can WPP win new business? We have demonstrated that the business can return back to growth, and we have won new businesses. We won six of the major pitches we have done since that time. Where we were the incumbent agency, we won three&amp;nbsp;out of the four pitches,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As part of the presentation, Read gave a glimpse into the future of WPP. “I am optimistic about the future of our industry and for the future of WPP,” he said. He said that the common complaint he hears from clients is that “we are not moving quickly enough and that we are too complex to get access to, we have assets and capabilities in the group that they (clients) don’t know about.” Proposing a solution to this problem, Read said that WPP will “liberate the skills, talents and resources inside the group and focus them on clients.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structure and Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that WPP will look at the non-performing parts of the business in North America and restructure the business by the end of the year. “We need to make sure that we have discipline in terms of how we add to the group and how we build our balance sheet, so that&amp;nbsp;sort of sums up to a strategy review by year end. We’ll come back to it&amp;nbsp;before the end of the year and look at the actions we’re taking to return the business to better position for growth and to address the non-performing parts of our business, primarily in North America, in the creative agencies within the data investment management part of the Company as well as any restructuring costs that maybe needed in the associated benefits with them,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that in places where clients are focused operative agencies, “you need to have stronger creative agencies to challenge that because we have stronger businesses with better work, better strategy, better reputations,&amp;nbsp;in short,&amp;nbsp;those companies have the capabilities that they need to grow.” Speaking about disruption due to technology, he said, “Data investment management particularly in the United States has been challenged. Work has been disrupted by different ways of getting to the same answer, using technology. And in&amp;nbsp;North America I think is where&amp;nbsp;the sort of the intersection of those two trends is&amp;nbsp;most pronounced."&lt;br&gt;On the speculation about the sale of research arm Kantar, Read said that&amp;nbsp;"no decision has been made" so far and "we'll update you at the right time."  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shifting Debate from In-housing to On-Site&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read said that historically agencies have been reluctant to let people work outside of operations. Consultancies on the other hand have been more familiar to do that. “I’d like to thank any of our clients who are looking to sort of outsource and the consultants who bring&amp;nbsp;them in house; they&amp;nbsp;should have a conversation with us. And I think we can very effectively develop solutions with them, I think it’s an opportunity for us if we do it correctly,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vision for Co-locations&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Simplifying the structure of the organisation is one of the key areas that Read will focus on as he dons the hat of CEO. He said that Lindsay Pattison, chief transformation officer, is working on how WPP services its large clients and stop&amp;nbsp;silos from getting in the way. “We have too many companies and brands. We need to think about how we streamline it.” He cited the example of the merger of Burson-Marsteller and Cohn &amp;amp; Wolfe to create Burson Cohn &amp;amp; Wolfe (BCW) and said, “We are seeing no degradation in revenue, if anything the revenues of the two businesses together are doing better.” He also said breaking down the silos has reduced&amp;nbsp;some operating costs. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said he will not be keen on merging agencies,&amp;nbsp;as&amp;nbsp;suggested by Forrester. “We need to have enough brands to manage client conflict but not so many that it makes the business impenetrable to understand,” he said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The country managers, like CVL Srinivas in India, will play a greater role in “bringing together our operations in countries,” Read said. “We cannot underestimate the power of co-location,” he said. He said that over the next two years about 40,000 of the 1,31,000 WPP employees will be in co-locations.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WPP will not compete with Technology Giants&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He said that WPP needs to help clients manage data and not necessarily own that data. On technology he said WPP will not compete with Google, Adobe, or Microsoft, by developing technology but instead integrate that technology. He said that what clients are looking for is “how we embed data much more deeply in our offer, and that doesn’t mean buying technology or developing technology;&amp;nbsp;increasingly&amp;nbsp;it means integrating other people's technology leveraging the investment that the others are making between them.&amp;nbsp;Google, Adobe, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, Oracle to name a few are&amp;nbsp;probably spending $10 billion on advertising and marketing technology and we can't compete with them,” he said.     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competing with Consultancies &lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He noted that WPP is competing with consulting businesses in fast-growing segments. “We do think we are competing with the consulting businesses,” he said. Read said that this competition is not in the creative aspect of the business, where WPP has an edge over consulting companies. “WPP can punch above its weight in terms of competing with consulting companies. But we are not in denial that that is happening.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read said that technology giants such as&amp;nbsp;Alibaba, Amazon, Google, Tencent and Facebook are all competing with WPP for talent, attention and by going directly to clients. “But I do think that there is a role for WPP in that mix. We spend $ 5bn per year with Google and $ 2.5 bn with Facebook; we just need to have a constructive relationship with them.” He said this includes pointing out when these platforms are doing badly, and noted that WPP has never shied away from doing that. “We have held them to high standards in terms of viewability, adjacency to content, and other areas that clients find valuable.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Talent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Observing that all stakeholders agree that there is need for change, Read said that there is a need for “radical evolution” of the industry. “We need to make WPP the destination for the millennial talent that is also going to Google and Facebook and should come to WPP. If we look at the parts of the business that are not performing as well as we’d like them to, talent is in many cases at the heart of it. So, we need to refresh and rejuvenate our talent.”</news:description>

      <news:title>We will sell 50-60% inventory before Bigg Boss12 goes on air: Raj Nayak, Viacom18</news:title>
      <news:description>An educational programme on human psychology--this is how Viacom18 Chief Operating Officer Raj Nayak describes&amp;nbsp;Bigg Boss, one of the most controversial and awaited reality shows on&amp;nbsp;television.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 12th edition of Big Boss&amp;nbsp;hosted by actor Salman Khan is all set to&amp;nbsp;premiere on Colors TV on September 16 (Sunday) at 9pm.  This year, the theme of the show is ‘Iss bar aa rahi hai interesting jodi’. Amidst the dreamy setting of a beach, BiggBoss12 will have assorted couples battling it out to survive 100 days under the constant glare of multiple cameras and Salman Khan’s lively supervision. The&amp;nbsp;12th season of Bigg Boss also&amp;nbsp;marks nine years of Colors’ association with Salman Khan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the fan-following of the show, Nayak said Big Boss is a profitable concept and has earned a loyal audience base over the years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“No other GEC  show has the kind of loyal base of viewers that Bigg Boss has. The show has not only earned us a loyal audience base over the years, but has also earned us rich dividends in terms of partnerships and alliances. The concept has remarkable potential, and through the years, we have been able to improvise it with newer themes, newer elements and newer faces. It's a profitable show.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There will not be much change in the format of the show. “The format of the show remains the same. It's the theme that keeps changing and this time it's ‘vichitra&amp;nbsp;jodi’. The house wears a new look.  The interesting part of this show is casting. If we get the casting right, half of the work&amp;nbsp;is done,” shared Nayak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The show has Parle Agro Appy Fizz on board as the ‘presenting’ sponsor and Oppo F9 Pro as the ‘powered by’ sponsor. Panasonic OLED, Capital Foods and Loreal are the associate sponsors and there are a few more in the pipeline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on advertisers’ response, Nayak said the buzz has been overwhelming.  “This is a good indicator of true partnerships and a sign that our clients are happy with their association. We are in the process of signing two-three more advertisers. Hopefully, we will sell approximately 50-60 per cent of the inventory before the show goes on air.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On ad rates, Nayak said, “Our ad rates haven't increased substantially this year. It has  just taken a 5 per cent hike. At the end of the day,&amp;nbsp;we feel that&amp;nbsp;our advertisers should get value.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The show will also be aired on the network’s youth and entertainment channel, MTV. However, it will be edited slightly differently for the MTV audience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“MTV has a different kind of audience. They love Bigg Boss and they want more of Bigg Boss. So we have put it up on the channel at a different time. The audience base&amp;nbsp;has doubled compared to last year,” said Nayak.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abhishek Rege, CEO, Endemol Shine India, said, “Keeping our audiences intrigued and entertained year on year has always been our aim at Endemol Shine India. This time, we have introduced a unique concept of ‘vichitra   jodis’ in the Bigg Boss house. This season our interesting mix of contestants will also be paired up! What will be exciting to see is if these partnerships become their strength or their weakness and how these jodis will deal with the out-of-the-box tasks given to them. This, added to the various twists and surprises we have planned for them, will make Bigg Boss12 a complete entertainment package."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about their association with Big Boss, Nadia Chauhan, Joint Managing Director and Chief Marketing Officer at Parle Agro, said, "At Parle Agro, we have an ambitious vision for the future coupled with high growth targets for our brands. Aligned to this vision, a core part of our media strategy is to associate with the largest television properties. And in the entertainment segment, Bigg Boss continues to be the largest platform. Its success and format have been a perfect fit for us to connect with our consumers.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On digital, Voot will have exclusive properties of ‘Unseen Undekha’--&amp;nbsp;all unseen and dropped footage-- and ‘Cutless’ – full versions of tasks, nominations, fights and drama of the show. The platform is also launching season 2 of ‘Bigg-Buzz’ -- the digital extension of Bigg Boss that discusses the weekly ongoings in the house.</news:description>

      <news:title>Chennai based Cover It Up partners with Marvel Studios as the official merchandiser </news:title>
      <news:description>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCV) films has created quite a buzz recently by becoming the highest-grossing film franchise of all time. According to media reports, the films produced by Marvel Studios have raked in over $17.5 billion at the global box office. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, the California based Marvel Studios, which is one of the biggest production houses in the world has a South Indian connection. Chennai based creative design company Cover It Up has been signed on as the official merchandiser for Marvel studios. Cover it Up was in the news during the release of the Rajinikanth starrer Kaala, as they were the official merchandiser for the film. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536151157_BuKXH8_snap-back-tee.jpg" style="width:443px;height:443px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about Cover It Up’s new association with Marvel Studios, Ronak Sarda, Founder, Cover It Up said, “After developing a base of 400,000 fans on social media by selling pop-culture merchandise, a&amp;nbsp;lot of our customers started asking us to design something on super-heroes. We realised that Marvel is the association we should be looking forward to, considering the growing fan following they have, we went straight to their Indian head-office. We told them that we had some ideas we wanted to implement with their existing designs and they liked the idea and gave us the nod.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the coming months, the team at Cover It Up have collaborated to launch some exciting tech-concept clothing, 3D phone cases (patent pending), wall arts, t-shirts, mugs and products which are easily affordable with pricing not more than Rs. 500. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536151154_UkYeIg_captain-shield.jpg" style="width:443px;height:443px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We want to make sure that everyone gets a different experience altogether and, in this way, we reach out to a larger portion of the audience. Our water repellent clothing line is one such example and so are the 3D cases,” added Ronak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team at Cover it Up were in talks with Marvel Studios India team for quite some time to launch official merchandise. The deal was confirmed in August last week and Cover It up has already launched their first season of products which have received positive response.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536151155_Rs5HyN_marvel-ad-white-tee.jpg" style="width:443px;height:443px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We have launched our concept glow in dark tees along with 3D cases and four other categories. Because of our pricing, which starts from 299, there is something for every Marvel geek,” said Ronak. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Cover It Up has managed to gain good traction in South India because of their association in the past with Rajinikanth movies, Kabali and Kaala. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We would like to focus on our audience which is already a part of our big family. A video production team is also working towards showcasing the products online in the best way possible,” said Ronak, talking on the marketing strategies followed by them. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536151154_a6BEty_Thor.jpg" style="width:443px;height:443px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Although Cover it up fan following is from various cities, I think it is about time we start taking our presence offline as well. We have been in talks with many people who want to help us open experience stores in the metros of the country. This way, the growing social media presence along with experience stores will not only add more value but also give a sense of quality which we've been striving towards,” said Sarda, talking on the road map ahead. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team at Cover It up is investing a lot of time into R&amp;amp;D to create more products with a unique aspect. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are already trying to add tech to clothing and are also in talks with one of the biggest production houses to launch the apparel soon. We want to focus on such things where people are amazed, not only at the pricing, but in the equal amount of thought we've put into trying to create something different,” concluded Sarda.</news:description>

      <news:title>Teachers' Day: Admen and their creative mentors</news:title>
      <news:description>The teacher-student bond has been one of the most celebrated themes in the Indian advertising. And rightly so, over the years, we've seen spots that beautifully tapped emotions showcasing this relationship. This made us wonder who are the teachers or mentors behind the creative minds of those who roll out such brilliant communications. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So we asked our adverting maestros about one teacher or mentor who has played an integral role in their advertising journey by being their guiding light as they chased their dreams. That one person who made a difference to their lives. The brightest stars of Indian advertising open up. Read on...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amer Jaleel, Group Chairman &amp;amp; Chief Creative Officer, Mullen Lintas&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;A lot of us in advertising grew up with the concept of the not-present teacher. And no that does not mean that our bosses were at gin lunches all the time, well not entirely at least. Our bosses were different and our teachers were different. We had no access to teachers; there were only people who we chose to learn from. But unlike Eklavya, we did not put up images of our Dronas. Instead, we pinned up the work of those who we considered masters. Bosses toh class liya kartey the, sikhaney waale toh aur hi the!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bobby Pawar, MD &amp;amp; Chief Creative Officer, Publicis Worldwide&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have quite a few people to mention here. They include Rick Boyko, Steve Hayden, Marty Orzio and Piyush. They have made a difference to my journey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Josy Paul, Chairman, BBDO India &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was fortunate to find myself surrounded by a commonwealth of amazing teachers. Emotional angel investors of my world. They taught me everything I know and they encouraged me to think for myself. They pushed me hard to take the leap but they were always behind me to break my fall. Suresh Mallick at Ogilvy&amp;amp;Mather. Alyque Padamsee, Kersy Katrak, Balki and Neville D’Souza at Lowe Lintas. Piyush Pandey, Ranjan Kapur and Madhukar Sabnavis when we set up a young challenger agency called ‘David’ for Ogilvy (now a worldwide agency.) Andrew Robertson, Chris Thomas and Ajai Jhala at BBDO India (we set up BBDO India from scratch.) I am blessed by these awesome mentors and chief motivation officers. They provoked me to fly. I am made of them. Thank you, angels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kunal Jeswani, Chief Executive, Ogilvy India&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teachers come in many forms. Family: my mom, my brother, both artists, both strong early influences in their own way. Teachers: so many that, through school, college and work, trained me to be better than I was, and drove me to be more than I thought I could be. And finally, people I've worked with: M Raghunath, Anand Halve, Mohammed Khan, Maia Katrak, Madhukar Sabnavis and Piyush Pandey. There is, hopefully, a little bit them in everything I am today.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rohit Ohri, Group Chairman &amp;amp; Chief Executive Officer, FCB India&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ram Ray, Founder Chairman of Response India, was my first boss in advertising. He taught me the most important lesson in the advertising business -- when you pay attention to detail, the big picture takes care of itself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rahul Jauhari, Joint President &amp;amp; Chief Creative Officer, Rediffusion India &amp;amp; Everest Brand Solutions&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I sincerely hope every entrant in this field gets the kind of mentors I have been fortunate to have. Gull Sen showed me the strategic sharpness that a creative person is capable of. And Chax (KS Chakravarthy) who taught me that true leadership is all about working on creating the next line of leaders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Raghu Bhat, Director, Scarecrow M&amp;amp;C Saatchi&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ravi Deshpande, who was the Chief Creative Officer of Contract Advertising, played a big role in my career. We were in the Windows batch and I had made a presentation on the parallels between advertising and F1. He started laughing out aloud. I got transferred to Contract Delhi but I used to write letters to him about my experiences in a wry Brit style, which he really enjoyed. Whenever he used to visit Delhi, he made it a point to spend time with me. All these things made a big difference. It gave me the confidence that I can create work that people will enjoy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subhash Kamath, CEO and Managing Partner, BBH India&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Piyush Pandey, Suresh Mullick, Chintamani Rao, Ranjan Kapur, Ravi Gupta, Alok Nanda, Vikas Gaitonde, Elsie Nanji, Mohammed Khan, Matthew Godfrey, Jeffrey Yu, Miles Young, John Hegarty, Nigel Bogle, Simon Sherwood and to the hundred other seniors &amp;amp; juniors who’ve taught me so much over the years, Happy Teacher’s Day!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tarun Rai, Chief Creative Officer, J. Walter Thompson South Asia&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had not planned to be in advertising for more than a couple of years. After starting my career with Asian Paints, I thought a short stint in advertising would prepare me well for a long career in marketing. But I went on to spend the next 19 years in advertising and JWT. There are so many people who I can attribute my long innings in advertising to. But if I had to narrow it down, it has to be two very important people who started me off on this journey. As a teacher it was Manoj Berry, my first boss in advertising. He literally taught me advertising. I imbibed his passion and his idealism. And the other was Sunil Gupta. He hired me. And he mentored me through my career in JWT. Between the two, I learnt to love our business and got the right opportunities to grow as a professional. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rana Barua, Former Chief Executive Officer, Creativeland Asia&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mentors in our industry are rare. Yet, I have been privileged to have a few of them who I look up to and consult a lot. Just want to thank them on this special day for always being around.</news:description>

      <news:title>Digital our biggest revenue source in India: Ashish Trivedi, FreakOut</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;In an era where consumers are susceptible to ad blockers and are seeking interruption-free experiences, how do marketers and advertisers still get their brands noticed? Given this particular scenario, the time is likely to favour native advertising where in; “its immersive and non-intrusive traits blend seamlessly into the publisher’s content feed, thus enabling consumer engagement with rich content”, claims Ashish Trivedi, Country Head, India, FreakOut Pvt. Ltd, a mobile marketing platform with in-feed native ads, in-feed video and television sync products in South East Asia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In an interview with exchange4media, Trivedi talks about how the digital medium today across a spectrum of categories has been a major source of revenue for their global marketing technology company&amp;nbsp;in India. However, he also points out at the dark side of digital advertising wherein brand safety, advertising fraud and user data privacy are some of the key concern areas today. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the initial marketing plans that you are focusing on to accelerate FreakOut's strategic pan-Asia expansion?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our focus is on brand building through tactical expansion. This means that we will focus on presence at marketing forums and selected events across India. We plan to engage more with brands and agencies for future partnerships with them in order to address complex challenges throughout the consumer journey. We are adopting both, organic and inorganic growth models, depending on where we see the most pertinent synergies with the most promising long-term potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What new offerings are you planning to bring to the market to complement FreakOut's innovative mobile marketing services?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Owing to our native ad-platform, we have established an initial footprint in the Indian market. Now we want to enhance our offering by tailoring it towards what our clients’ business and marketing needs are. Building a video product was almost a no-brainer, given the increased interest in video as a format and the exponential growth in video consumption. Video has already garnered substantial interest from various categories of brands, including Beauty, Automotive, FMCG, and many others. To be a right fit in a dynamic and multifaceted market like India, we have invested in companies like Dataweave and SilverPush, which can bring unique technology solutions to the table, to be able to solve critical marketing complexities across various touchpoints in the consumer’s journey.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What percentage of FreakOut's ad spends are on digital and what are some of the significant digital spends that have contributed in leveraging FreakOut's efficiency and maximised its reach?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In India, our revenue mostly comes from digital, but throughout a gamut of categories, we work closely with both, brands and agencies. Our latest video product is geared to drive growth by connecting brands and agencies with the MOAT certified premium inventory on local apps in over 100 countries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While FreakOut does engage in in-feed native ads, between native channels and traditional content marketing, what according to you is a better platform which impacts growth heavily and why?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to content marketing efforts of brands, there are two aspects to consider: content production and afterwards, content distribution. Having great content is only half the battle won. The even bigger challenge is distribution which needs to span across the right mediums to drive conversations and achieve business outcomes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Today, advertisers face two core problems: banner blindness and scale. In-feed native ads address both. Because of the immersive and non-intrusive qualities, native ads blend into the publisher’s content feeds enabling consumer conversations with highly engaging content quality and narrative. Native ads can also help brands achieve exponential scale as most of the premium publishers prefer them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you plan to improve/change the current engagement model for FreakOut with the ad agencies?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We intend to build close relationships with all leading agency partners in India. We look forward to adding value through meaningful consumer interactions which will directly result in achieving business outcomes for brands. FreakOut’s portfolio of technology solutions will support agency partners to solve complex marketing challenges. We aim to be a trusted partner of the agencies whom they can rely on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While marketers are enamoured by digital advertising, how does one efficiently record data metrics in order to monetise viewership, in an era where trust is at the lowest?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Trust can be established on the foundation of both, relevance and context. Today, consumers are extremely cautious about sharing their own data with brands. The key is to make the messaging relevant through the customisation of narrative and formats. To that end, being personal is pivotal. Personalisation could range from narrative and format of the messaging to parameters such as time of day and type of screens. Efficiency and effectiveness of conversations is surely going to be critical to harness true potential.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your take on the agenda of 'Video First'. In digital how is this of any help to you to increase market share?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Video First is very critical for a market like India for two reasons. Firstly, video content consumption in India has doubled since 2017 due to the democratisation of data prices which have plummeted by almost 20 per cent. Secondly, affordable smartphones from companies such as Huawei, Xiaomi, VIVO, Oppo have become increasingly available. As the trends demonstrate, video is projected to account for 70 to 75 per cent of mobile traffic by 2020. Hence, video is going to be at the forefront for all key players - be it marketers or marketing technology providers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think digital is here to take over traditional media as a preferred medium of business &amp;amp; engagement? What are the challenges that the digital market is facing at present?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Digital media spend is definitely growing at an exponential pace – averaging approximately 30 to 35 per cent YOY. Consider TV or Print - they are both growing, but not nearly at the same rate. TV spends are projected to grow by approximately 12 to 13 per cent and print at 4 to 5 per cent. The distinct advantage of digital lies in precise attribution and measurement of outcomes. It is almost mandatory to be looking at digital as a key medium to drive consumer conversations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A few key challenges that our digital advertising industry is banding together to solve include: advertising fraud, brand safety and user data privacy. Furthermore, there is a need for vernacular advertising content from leading brands. This is because the next phase of growth is going to be across Tier 2 &amp;amp; Tier 3 cities in India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Can a brand be built exclusively on digital in 2018?</news:title>
      <news:description>&lt;p&gt;Digital has been the dominant narrative across sectors for quite some time now. Digital tools are redefining marketing strategy and brands are leveraging the medium to maximise their reach. With digital becoming quite the buzzword, the next obvious question that comes to one’s mind is: Can brands have a digital-only marketing strategy? Is it possible for companies to overlook traditional advertising mediums such as TV &amp;amp; print and opt for only digital platforms? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, we explore the possibility through the opinions expressed by some experts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Sai Narayan, Associate Director &amp;amp; Marketing Head, Policybazaar.com &amp;amp; Paisabazaar.com, while the manner in which users consume content may have undergone a change, when it comes to marketing, TV is the medium they still trust more.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Indian audience has a psyche that still makes them believe more in brands that appear on TV versus an online platform. While the manner in which users these days consume content on mobile and digital mediums may have brought about some changes (in the dynamics), people still have a lot more trust for what they watch on TV. Hence, established brands may not feel the need to adopt any other medium of advertising,” said Narayan, while speaking at an event recently.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, with new companies mushrooming up in the advertising space by the day, competition is getting stiffer. In such a scenario, Narayan feels, generating revenue is a bigger concern for companies irrespective of the medium involved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Be it TV or digital, whichever platform a brand invests in, it is crucial that it drives RoI. Everything a firm spends has to have a clear RoI, which is then linked back to sales. And so, we may not get involved in indoor or outdoor campaigns or invest a lot in digital for that matter.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shubho Sengupta, a digital marketer and advisor to brands &amp;amp; industry associations, believes that a brand should have a strong motive to invest in digital platforms. One should not adopt the medium just because others are doing it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“A company should be well aware of the facilities it can avail of by being on a digital platform. There should be a strong motive behind going digital. It should not be done just because competitors are into it,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sengupta said that till a few years ago, marketers were hesitant to engage with digital too much. “And even now, some brands do not exactly know why they are investing in the medium.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While a lot has changed when it comes to accepting digital as a medium, it remains to be seen if brands are ready to take up the fast-growing digital space exclusively, he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apurva Chamaria, influencer, investor &amp;amp; Chief Revenue Officer, RateGain, meanwhile, has a different take on the whole issue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to him, “In today’s time, the role of advertising is diminishing with time. What is crucial is to build a strong and great product for it to connect with the consumers. Going big on marketing and advertising on any platform will not help if the product does not speak for itself.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expressing his views on how impactful brands on digital can be, Saurabh Uboweja CEO, Brands of Desire, said, “Every business is a different case study. There is no one formula that can help crack businesses on digital.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Uboweja believes that with rapid digitisation, digital becoming traditional could be the next trend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“To a large extent, it seems digital could turn traditional soon. This is not only because everyone is going digital these days, but because everyone is claiming to be knowing the platform inside out. However, I believe that the RoI factor doesn’t let one experiment much, which is very much the need of the hour. But to explore more options and generate awareness regarding one’s business, sticking to just one medium wouldn’t be of much help.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Hence, it seems like companies today do not really need a working model to follow. They should rather build one for themselves. At the end of the day, to stay relevant in today’s changing market, it is crucial to know how to defend what one is doing,” said Uboweja.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Taranjeet Singh Steps Down as Twitter India Country Director </news:title>
      <news:description>Twitter India Country Director Taranjeet Singh has announced his decision to move on from Twitter India.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Late Tuesday evening Singh tweeted, “Hello everyone, after 4 amazing years, I have decided to move on from @TwitterIndia - from being one of the first @Twitter employees in #India, to building up the sales team from the ground up, to leading our expansion and investments as the India Country Director #AmazingRide.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Singh’s Twitter journey began in January 2015. He joined the social media platform’s India office as Business Head and was leading the charge for sales and marketing support for Twitter's advertisers in India. In 2017 he was elevated to the position of Country Director for Twitter India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Singh transitions out of his position over the next month, Bajaji Krish, Global Head of Revenue Strategy and Operations will be the interim country head. Singh tweeted, "He's coming from the US to be interim country lead until my replacement is hired. We'll ensure that @Twitter won't miss a beat here." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Singh added, “I'm proud to say that @TwitterIndia is in a strong position and will continue to grow stronger in the years to come. I want to thank all our partners, brands and agencies for their continued belief, trust and support in making my journey so incredible at Twitter #Grateful.” &lt;br&gt;Commenting on Singh's departure, a Twitter spokesperson said, "We thank Taran for nearly four years of contributions and leadership to Twitter India. He built up our India sales team across the country and, most recently as our India country director, he led our cross-functional effort that has made India both one of our largest and fastest growing markets today. Under his leadership, we have seen strong business performance, a diversified client base, and many innovations for Twitter across India." &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He did not divulge any details about what he plans to do next.</news:description>

      <news:title>Need of the hour is a national OOH policy: Charanjeet Arora, CEO, Kinetic Advertising</news:title>
      <news:description>Kinetic India recently promoted Charanjeet Arora and Rachana Lokhande as new Co-CEOs of Kinetic Advertising&amp;nbsp;India Pvt. Ltd.. This follows the resignation of Suresh Balakrishna, CEO, South Asia and Middle East. Arora has been working with Kinetic Advertising&amp;nbsp;India since November 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We spoke to him about his views on the OOH medium, measures companies must take to promote programmatic digital OOH across markets and growth of DOOH in the near future.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited Excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OOH as a medium to connect in non-metro cities:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arora says, “OOH has always been a key media in local markets and has played a vital role. Telecom, Retail, Education, Real Estate, Automobile sectors have always used OOH as the key media in non-metros. There are many advantages of OOH in non-metros, which has always encouraged brands to advertise in OOH space."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reasons for this he says is Low cost of media, Contextual placement and Customised communication at key touch points. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Majority of brands use OOH in non-metros to promote sales schemes, which immediately converts into numbers, so, in a way non metro clients understand the power of media well and believe in ROI," he says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programmatic digital OOH across markets&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to him, programmatic will help media owners to earn maximum revenue and utilisation of inventory. “Automation is the future of every business and technologies across the globe are redefining business and enhancing efficiencies. It is high time for large OOH media owners to automate availability and publish card rates on their sites," Arora says.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Changes needed in the OOH space&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;He perceives digital formats as the future of OOH business, but highlights that “the present method of printing flex is not eco-friendly and whatever is not eco friendly is not going to be there for long."&lt;br&gt;Digital media will ensure transparency; speed of execution and digital formats are definitely more dynamic and can accommodate multiple creatives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He sees regularisation and standardisation of OOH formats across markets, and says, there’s more transparency in OOH business. He also admits, “There is a possibility of national OOH policy, which is the need of the hour."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Major OOH companies are partnering in infrastructure growth of India through BOOT models and working with governments and to build a smarter India by creating international design BQS and more public facilities in Tier 1 and Tier 2 towns," he adds.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Kinetic ensures high ROI&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Arora explained how Kinetic ensures maximum ROI to the buyer on their platform. “Data, Technology and Content are the future of the media business. Kinetic uses its patented global tool Aureus, in planning, which is scientific and ensures most accurate planning and therefore, maximum return of investment. Kinetic uses AIM scoring to select the best sites for brands, based on brand requirements and the market."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Because of the sheer size and volume, we get best the deals in the OOH space and we ensure we pass on the benefits to our esteemed clients. We are transparent to the core and ensure fair dealing at all levels; the idea is to deliver best to our clients. We believe in creating values for brands associated with us," says Arora.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DOOH as a medium of the future&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;When asked as to how he sees the growth of DOOH as a medium in the future, he says, “DOOH would grow at high pace in the coming years and this will help in better digital integrations. Consumer behaviours are changing fast and the way consumers consume media is also changing rapidly. Mobile has become a major media and digital OOH would help brands connect with consumers on mobile by using smart integrations and through innovative OOH+ Mobile interface."</news:description>

      <news:title>WPP revenue down 2.1%; new CEO Mark Read says strategy update by year end</news:title>
      <news:description>WPP announced its half yearly results on September 4. Reported revenue is down 2.1% at £7.493 billion,&amp;nbsp;but choosing to focus on the positives as the Group won new accounts, newly appointed CEO Mark Read said, “The second quarter of 2018 was WPP’s first quarter of like-for-like growth since Q1 2017, and the company has performed strongly in terms of winning and retaining business over the period.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Estimated net new business billings of $3.2 billion were won in the first half of the year, indicating return to a strong performance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting  on the new strategy as he joins the Group at a time that is rather uncertain, Read said, “As Chief Executive, my focus will be on invigorating our company and returning the business to stronger, sustainable growth. Our review of strategy is underway, addressing our structure, our underperforming operations, particularly in the United States, and how we position the company for the future. We will provide an update by the year end.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking of the growth areas, Read said, “At our first quarter trading update, we said there was no standing still, and in the last few months we have made progress in a number of important areas. &lt;br&gt;“We have focused our efforts on providing more effectively integrated solutions to clients and, in competitive pitches, we have won or grown business with clients including Adidas, Hilton, Mars, Mondelez, Shell and T-Mobile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We have looked at our offering and begun to focus our portfolio through 15 disposals and divestments, including Globant and AppNexus, generating cash proceeds of £676 million so far this year, which will also strengthen our balance sheet and improve our average net debt to EBITDA ratio.&lt;br&gt;“And we have accelerated initiatives that will simplify our organisation, making it easier for us to manage and clients to access, with, for example, co-locations opened or announced in New York, Kuala Lumpur, Prague and Toronto. &lt;br&gt;“The mix of performance by geography and function and a decision to invest in the growing areas of our business resulted in a slightly lower headline PBIT margin.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Highlights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;•  Reported revenue down 2.1% at £7.493 billion, impacted by currency headwinds of 5.0%. Constant currency revenue up 2.9%, like-for-like revenue up 1.6% (Q2 up 2.4%)&lt;br&gt;•  Constant currency revenue less pass-through costs up 1.4%, like-for-like revenue less pass-through costs up 0.3% (Q2 up 0.7%)&lt;br&gt;•  Headline profit before interest and tax £821 million down 7.0%, down 2.3% in constant currency&lt;br&gt;•  Headline PBIT margin 13.3% down 0.5 margin points reportable and constant currency, down 0.4 margin points like-for-like&lt;br&gt;•  Headline profit before tax £735 million down 7.4%, down 2.5% in constant currency &lt;br&gt;•  Profit before tax £846 million up 8.6%, up 14.2% in constant currency primarily reflecting net exceptional gains   &lt;br&gt;•  Profit after tax £705 million up 11.3%, up 16.8% in constant currency &lt;br&gt;•  Headline diluted earnings per share 42.6p down 6.2%, down 1.3% in constant currency &lt;br&gt;•  Diluted earnings per share 53.4p up 14.6%, up 20.3% in constant currency&lt;br&gt;•  Dividends per share 22.7p flat with 2017 &lt;br&gt;•  Share buy-backs of £201 million, equivalent to 1.3% of the issued share capital</news:description>

      <news:title>Broadcasters publish RIO in compliance with new TRAI tariff order</news:title>
      <news:description>Most of the major broadcasters have published their Reference Interconnect Offer (RIO) along with the Interconnection Agreement, in compliance with the new tariff regime introduced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI). The deadline for compliance was August 31, 2018.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big broadcasters, including Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited, Sony Pictures Networks India Private Limited and TV18 Broadcast Limited, have declared their RIOs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“This RIO shall be effective for the term commencing from 29-December-2018 (i.e., at the end of 180 days from the date of TRAI’s press release dated 3-July-2018, read with TRAI’s notifications dated 3-March-2017),” reads the RIO published by TV18 Broadcast Ltd.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, Star India, which is one of the petitioners against TRAI tariff and interconnect order, is yet to file its ROI.

      <news:title>Aim to crack actionable insights for brands: Anjali Malthankar, Tonic Worldwide</news:title>
      <news:description>Needless to say that in an era of information overload and debates over AI (Artificial Intelligence) Vs HI (Human Intelligence), clients are excited about the endless possibilities of insight mining. However, they are often faced with confusing and opposing POVs from multiple research reports. To tackle this head-on, independent digital agency, Tonic Worldwide has launched a unique research division called ‘Gipsi’. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team at Tonic felt that this problem needs the eye of a Gipsi, one which can connect multiple dots&amp;nbsp;faster and top it up with a unique worldview, which comes from various experiences of having worked across digital, research, advertising and marketing on a variety of categories and brands. So they have designed a unique hybrid approach to mine actionable insights from multiple data points, by applying tools such as deep listening, netnography, digital ethnography, virtual surveys, GA and AI. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The team also launched its own life logging Mobile App, Gipsi. The app will be used to ask relevant questions to the consumers at the right interventions to make it contextual and get unique insights. Anjali Malthankar, National Strategy Director, Tonic Worldwide, shared insights on the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Malthankar said the starting point of Gipsi was their ‘humans without boundaries’ philosophy - a step in the direction of humanising the digital offering. "As a digital team when we started approaching every brief with this philosophy we realised we were bridging a huge gap in the market. The gap was getting wider with specialisations mushrooming and creating fragmented views than helping clients get a holistic picture. Thus, our Gipsi research division was born out of clients’ needs," she revealed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She said that the vision from this move is to decode and crack actionable insights for brands, leading to breakthrough solutions faster by using AI + HI approach. "Why just brands, we believe world/social issues could be decoded and solved through Gipsi. Remember, we are humans without boundaries!"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Malthankar pointed out that this is not just a research approach, even their teams who work on various brands are now designed to offer HI + AI. "For some clients we have created a unique resource structure which is a combination of HI (Intelligent humans) +AI (E.g Gipsi App which interacts with consumers on brands’ behalf and Simon). I know you would want to know who is Simon? For that you will have to wait, in due course you will get to know more about Simon from our Co-founder and COO, Samir Asher," she said&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Gipsi, the life logging app is our secret sauce,&amp;nbsp;which really will enable us to deliver all the above promises and differentiate us in the market. It is currently showing a potential to be a product offering on its own," explained Malthankar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When quizzed about what kind of clients Gipsi will appeal to, Malthankar said that these would include clients who are ready to break the silos in understanding their consumers. "This platform will connect a lot of missing dots for clients who are trying to understand their consumers who are offline and online and get actionable insights on all aspects of their brands. It will answer the dilemma of taking action with isolated or fragmented POV from various research inputs vs a holistic POV," she reasoned.</news:description>

      <news:title>‘Closer the game, higher the viewership: Atit Mehta, Byju’s</news:title>
      <news:description>When cricket is mentioned it’s no surprise that most brands rush to it to create an impact and recall value associated with the sport. Several brands have actually launched themselves on the back of cricket tournaments, and some have even seen a huge growth and recall with cricket-centric campaigns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With Asia Cup around the corner (scheduled on September 15) there is a prospect of arch rivals India and Pakistan taking on one another on the pitch. We talk to Atit Mehta, Marketing Head, Byju’s, to get his perspective on marketing and advertising during cricket tournaments. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read on to know his advice on how brands can get maximum ROI and guaranteed eyeballs from a cricketing association, and Byju’s latest cricket-based campaigns:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How impactful is cricket as a vehicle for brand building?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the past couple of decades, cricket has played a critical role in brand building. There have been so many brands and so many examples where brands were actually launched on the back of cricket and today these have a strong equity among consumers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take us through some of your recent cricket-based campaigns. How have they worked out for Byju’s?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Byju’s, we have participated in almost all the cricket series that have taken place in the last three years, whether they are bilateral series or multi-national series. Our first TV campaign was launched during a bilateral series, our current campaign was also rolled out during an ICC cricket tournament and hopefully we will be able to roll out some of our future campaigns on the back of cricket tournaments as well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can brands do to derive greater ROI from cricket campaigns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a brand believes that the potential ROI on spends during a cricket tournament will be good, then they should definitely associate with such intense, popular tournaments. Once the investment is done, they should just sit back and enjoy the game. However, I should add that the brand owner must pray and hope that India does well and that the games are a last-ball finish. The closer the game, higher the viewership will be! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can brands leverage India-Pakistan rivalry to its maximum?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Historically, the India-Pakistan cricket matches have always had the entire national audience glued to their television screens. For a brand that is interested in reaching out to a mass audience, India-Pakistan games are the best opportunity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your favourite India – Pakistan moment?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are two moments that come to mind.&lt;br&gt;1. During the 2003 ICC World Cup in South Africa, the sixes that Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag hit off Shoiab Akhtar were fantastic&lt;br&gt;2. The first T20 World Cup where India and Pakistan were faced with a bowl out was the other memorable encounter. India won that game 3-0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the standard of cricket has improved among Asian countries?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The standard of cricket among all the Asian teams has definitely improved significantly. While India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka remain the Asian power houses, Bangladesh are no longer the minnows of Asian cricket. They have grown over the last 6-7 years and cannot be taken for granted any more. Even Afghanistan is growing as a cricketing nation and the fact that they have qualified for the ICC World Cup 2019 is testament to that fact.</news:description>

      <news:title>Asian Paints' launches latest series of 'Live Stylishly' for inspiring home décor ideas</news:title>
      <news:description>Asian Paints launched another exciting series of ‘How To videos’ for home décor ideas. Conceptualised, written and produced by Supari Studios, 'Live Stylishly' is a weekly series of inspiring home décor and interior design ideas which will help you transform your home into spaces which are functional yet aspirational. With these videos Asian Paints created an ecosystem of content across Pinterest, YouTube and IGTV for anyone looking for premium look-books and ideas to revamp their homes. The content lends a local twist while giving the consumers an understanding of the wide range of products Asian Paints has to offer. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are four versatile themes to enhance spaces such as bedrooms, study and living/dining room spaces. These themes were Nautical, Jewel Tones, Botanical and Gelato which were explored through 20 fun DIY videos curating a video catalogue for every homes’ makeover.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nisha Vasudevan, Director, Asian Paints Live Stylishly Season 3 says “We aimed to create inspirational and aspirational yet snackable content that will showcase the Asian Paints catalog by illustrating how colours transform a space. We went with snappy scripts complemented by supers that would ensure the audience retains the messaging even if audio didn't play. The spaces were revamped using choreography created using various sets of hands - they snap, click, and select throughout the videos, and act as catalysts for transformation. No characters are visible in the frames - this has allowed for seamless, fun and clutter-breaking visuals that focus on the spaces. One of the other challenges included the time-frame - we had just 3 days to shoot 20 videos. To achieve the above, we've used a mix of stop-motion, compositing and chroma cleverly. All departments had to work hard and smart, and this has translated into a set of neat, lucid and entertaining videos for Asian Paints' Live Stylishly Season 3."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Manoti Jain, Executive Producer, Supari Studios says “For Asian Paints Live stylishly, we wanted to build a brand IP that was strategically relevant and would serve as a powerful content territory for the brand. At the inception of the idea the focus was to build a content strategy that meets both the brand’s goals and engages with the intended audience. We have created a total of 20 videos that revolve around information that the consumers are constantly seeking for while doing up the house. As next steps we are looking to create more videos in the space making Home Decor synonymous with Asian Paints in India.”&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Stagnant budgets of clients is a challenge: KRP Reddy, Sakshi Group</news:title>
      <news:description>Since its launch a decade ago, Sakshi is today the second largest Telugu daily, both in readership and circulation numbers. KRP Reddy, Director – Advertising and Marketing, Sakshi Group, talks about the performance of the flagship paper, betting big on local retail advertisers and the challenge of upping revenues from advertisers. Below are the edited excerpts of the interview:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you evaluate the performance of Sakshi?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sakshi launched in March 2008 and we recently completed our 10th anniversary in March. It has been a steady progress since Day 1. We peaked in 2014, in terms of readership and circulation. Then there were elections and the division of the State of Andhra Pradesh into Andhra Pradesh and Telangana happened and there was some correction in circulation. After 2014, we stressed on circulation, we built on it and now we are maintaining our circulation at a steady level of over 11 lakh copies (as per ABC). We hope to do better as we go towards 2019 and are gearing up for the elections slated in both the States. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As per the last IRS data, your readership was at 98 lakhs…&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the last IRS there was a mix up in the readership of our variant. The IRS data surprised us as it showed more readership where our variant was not present and where the variant was present they were showing lesser readership. It was a mismatch and did not match with the ground reality so we took it up with the technical committee and explained where it went wrong and they accepted it. We now have a readership of 1 crore and 15 lakhs. IRS corrected this and sent a circular that this can be added to the readership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your expectations from the upcoming IRS and ABC?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABC probably there will not be much difference, we will be steady there plus or minus 1-2% but in terms of readership we expect to do much better. We are putting in an effort in penetrating the semi-urban areas and Tier II cities while concentrating on the urban cities of Hyderabad, Visakhapatnam and the new upcoming capital of Andhra Pradesh, Amaravati. We are also focusing on our tabloids. The focus is also in penetrating areas where even if only five copies are taken, we will supply it there. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has been the growth in revenues and also the growth in advertisers? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Last year, Print revenues grew by an aggregate of 5-7%. Most of it happened on the back of local advertisers. Our tabloids cover 270 constituencies and we are strong in local advertising and we get small advertisements like birthdays, obituaries, wedding anniversaries and even retirements. This is a trend in Andhra Pradesh and Telegana and we get a about 14-15% of revenues through this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the ratio&amp;nbsp;between the National advertisers and local retail?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ratio of national to local is almost 50:50. In local retail, textile, education retail, supermarkets, jewellery, real estate are all big, particularly in Hyderabad.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the biggest challenge you currently face?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;70% of the cost of manufacturing is newsprint. The cost of newsprint was around Rs 11-12 and now it has shot up to Rs 16-17 per copy. 80% of newsprint that Sakshi uses is imported. It is a big challenge and we are taking some internal measures. Cover price revision is one of the ideas but fortunately or unfortunately, we are governed by an association of newspapers - The Telangana State Newspapers Association and Andhra Pradesh Newspapers Association - and we are discussing with&amp;nbsp;the associations to increase the price. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By when and by how much would you look to increase the cover price?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We have proposed the price-point internally and have not come to a conclusion. However, probably by the end of September we will decide and increase the price. It is still in discussion and we don’t want to do it individually. If it was only Sakshi, we could have taken a decision but since all the brands are collectively in discussion to increase the price, we are waiting for everybody to come to one platform so it will not be an advantage to any one brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the other challenges?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The stagnant budgets of the clients, they are not growing at the pace of the cost that we are incurring. That is also a challenge to get the revenue from the advertisers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are you doing on the Digital front?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;We are quite strong on the Digital front with sakshi.com and SakshiBusiness.com is there. We will be launching sakshipost.com and sakshisamachar.com, our English and Hindi sites soon, both are presently in the beta phase.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will be the growth drivers?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The flagship is Print but we are also looking at Digital and are gearing up to some tie-ups. Though the growth rate appears to be 100-300%, the value of the &lt;br&gt;revenues is not very high when compared to print. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your future plans?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the next six to nine months, we see purely organic growth of the newspaper. There is no need for us at this stage to start any more editions or variant. However, we will try to understand the needs of the reader in a much better way because of the competition from the websites.</news:description>

The visuals of the John Krasinki-starrer show has been floating across the internet from the usual suspects such as,Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, to even&amp;nbsp;news portals of the Economic Times. Its Twitter account in particular has been seeing regular activity featuring GIFs and memes&amp;nbsp;made from the show's stills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536116715_lnwCgw_JackRyan2.jpg" style="width:443px;height:747px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the uninitiated, the entire first season, which premiered on August 31, follows Krasinski as he transforms from a desk-based CIA employee to a field agent on the hunt for terrorists.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536116718_gFXPJK_JackRyan3.jpg" style="width:443px;height:738px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Going all out in advertising its Prime Originals series across media is a regular part of Amazon Prime Video India’s marketing game. For local shows such as ‘Breathe’, it is speculated to have spent close to Rs 30 crore&amp;nbsp;on its marketing. Even for ‘The Grand Tour,’ a British motoring television series, the OTT platform brought in actor Anil Kapoor to host its season premiere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536115736_gyVmfR_jackryanarre.jpg" style="width:443px;height:432px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the case of ‘Jack Ryan’, the global streaming service took the partnership route by collaborating with content platform Terribly Tiny Tales where writers have penned down short stories themed on it. Arre, Indian entertainment content platform, featured articles and videos talking about the show and the protagonist.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Even globally, Amazon Prime Video has been spending big marketing bucks on its original series right from the start. One of the most sought after sporting events by brands, Super Bowl, was leveraged by the OTT service in February to unveil the first look of ‘Jack Ryan’ through a 60-second commercial. An ad spot in the Super Bowl brings in a huge traction of 100 million and&amp;nbsp;comes at an astronomical rate of $5.2 million. A solid marketing effort can easily cost $10 million. This gives a fair idea about the marketing budget allocated for this show. OTT employed myriad approaches combined into a single, large-scale event internationally. In India, it started creating buzz on the show since&amp;nbsp;May onwards.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536118047_VWvKUo_OOH-Promotion-of-%27Jack-Ryan%27-in-Toronto%2C-Canada1.jpg" style="width:443px;height:239px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s interesting to see how Amazon Prime Video is pulling out all stops for a character that has been played on the big screen by Hollywood actors such as, Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford, Ben Affleck and Chris Pine.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Deccan Herald launches travel supplement </news:title>
      <news:description>The Printers Mysore Private Ltd owned Deccan Herald (DH) has launched a weekly supplement that features travel-related content. The supplement has been named DH Travel.

In such a scenario, we felt a supplement that is devoted to travel would engage our readers.” &lt;br&gt;“The supplement features destinations that range from sleepy villages to bustling cities, sun-soaked beaches, snow-capped mountains, lush jungles and sweeping deserts, giving our readers vacation ideas that suit every interest and pocket.” He added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We do not have special reporters for DH Travel.

      <news:description>The Bangla television industry has come under the lens once again with TV actors going on a strike because of non-payment of dues. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to media reports, a notice from the Artist Forum wanted production houses to pay the dues of the actors within the 15th of the month.

      <news:title>Kerala floods wash out ad revenue worth billions</news:title>
      <news:description>The recent floods in Kerala are turning out to be more than just a humanitarian issue. For businesses it has been equally devastating as most of the sectors have suffered heavy financial loss, including local media players. The total loss to the media revenue is estimated to be in hundreds of crores.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traditionally media players in Kerala rely on the festive season around Onam for advertising revenue which also accounts for 40-50 per cent of the total annual sales of most brands in Kerala. If we take the example of consumer durables market in Kerala, it is estimated to be above Rs 2000 crore and more than half of the sales happen during Onam. This year too the local media players were looking to cash on the season but unexpected floods played havoc with the estimates.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact on Media Revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The local media has suffered on many fronts. Print, TV and radio players have been impacted the most as they sacrificed their prime ad spaces and time slots to help in the rescue operations by featuring campaigns and announcements. Almost all the state based newspapers carried full page campaign ads while the TV and radio channels ran ad free coverage of the floods. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“During the 15 to 20 days of floods, not a single ad appeared in any newspapers or on any TV channels. So it has been a total loss for the entire media in terms of revenue,” stated I Venkat, Director Eenadu Group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we look at last year, TV advertising alone attracted almost Rs 150 crore during the Onam season and this year’s revenue has been way below that mark. Speaking about the loss that the local media suffered, Varghese Chandy, Vice President, Marketing, Adverting Sales, Malayala Manorama said, “The floods happened during the prime season of the Malayam New Year, between this period the sales should have peaked but there was an absolute wash out. We also refused to take ads on the front page, because obviously it was not the right sentiment to give ads. Unlike any other state, all newspapers and most television channels refrained from advertising. We also didn’t take any front page ad and all this happened during the prime time.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In the extremely affected areas, newspapers did not reach, the distribution got really affected for 3-4 days in those areas but most of the papers reached the relief camps. But now things are back to normal. This was a well co-ordinated evacuation exercise even media organisations pitched in. We had a control room in our office with a team taking calls, noting down numbers and alerting the rescue teams including Navy and Air Force,” he further added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brands showed solidarity by pausing campaigns&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Anuj Madan, PHD India’s General Manager and Digital Lead for Delhi, brands also played their part by pausing their campaigns and thus showed solidarity with the affected population. He said, “Onam is of prime importance to consumers and brands. However, given the gravity of the situation in Kerala, many of our clients have paused their campaigns this year. While this certainly impacts the business of these brands, our clients understand the importance of standing in solidarity with their consumers during times like these, with many even taking steps to help out in whatever way they can. We have seen brands contributing from their own resources and/or creating easy opportunities for their consumers to contribute to the cause – from Paytm setting up simple donation methods to Amazon and Zomato delivering amenities and food on-ground in the disaster areas, and even Vistara flying doctors into Kerala for free. It’s during times like these that our clients can demonstrate they are more than consumer brands and an actual part of the community as well.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having borne the brunt of the natural calamity, the media industry in Kerala is limping back to normalcy. The festive season may be lost but the industry players are hopeful of a new start.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“During the Onam period we used to double the revenue on a monthly basis, and this time was a complete washout. Distribution was affected and we couldn’t reach all the places. Since the state is reviving there will be requirements of household products in the market, but we still have to see how much of it can compensate the Onam revenue,” stated. Kamal Krishnan PS, National Head, Integrated Media Solutions, Mathrubhumi.</news:description>

      <news:title>ZEEL announces MRP of all its channel as per TRAI tariff order</news:title>
      <news:description>Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited (ZEEL) has announced the maximum retail price (MRP) of all its channels under the new regime as per Regulation dated March 3, 2017. ZEEL uploaded the details on its website on Friday, August 31, 2018. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The a-la-carte of all SD &amp;amp; HD channels are under Rs 19 per month. The MRP of the basic bouquet for the Hindi Speaking Market (HSM) starts at Rs 45 per month for a suite of 23 channels. This includes channels such as Zee TV, &amp;amp;TV, Zee Cinema, &amp;amp;Pictures, Zee News, Zee Anmol, Big Ganga and many other channels. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ZEEL has declared multiple bouquets available to consumers across the country at different price points. Premium English channels such as Zee Café and &amp;amp;flix are available in a different bouquet. Each bouquet constitutes a mix of channels of different genres including General Entertainment, Movies, News, Infotainment and Music.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The network has decided to offer all its news channels along with its other channels like Zee Anmol, Big Ganga and Big Magic as part of these pay bouquets. As a result, these channels would not be available in the free-to-air (FTA) pack of private cable and DTH operators. However, these channels are likely to be available free of cost on DD Free Dish, the free-to-air digital direct-broadcast satellite television service owned and operated by the state-controlled public service broadcaster, Prasar Bharati.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On July 3, 2018, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) gave a 60-day deadline to broadcasters for publication of Reference Interconnect Offer, declaration of MRP and nature of channels, in connection with its tariff order. The deadline came to an end on August 31, 2018, but broadcasters are yet to comply with the order and the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable) Interconnection (Addressable Systems) Regulations, 2017. There was a hearing on the issue on August 27 but the Supreme Court deferred it to September 5, 2018.</news:description>

      <news:title>Content marketing is key to our digital strategy: Nishant Kashikar, Tourism Australia&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>In a bid to woo Indian travelers, Tourism Australia has launched a new tourism promotion campaign in India and South East Asia. The latest chapter in Tourism Australia's evolving 'There's Nothing Like Australia' campaign, 'UnDiscover Australia' specifically targets high value travellers in India, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536031985_D9D50N_content-jam-logo.jpg" style="width:350px;height:193px;float:right"&gt;&lt;br&gt;They have taken the wrapper off their fresh $10 million campaign for the South and South East Asian markets aimed at challenging perceptions of what a holiday down under means as a tourist. Nishant Kashikar, Country Manager, India &amp;amp; Gulf, Tourism Australia, chatted exclusively with exchange4media about the media executions being used for the campaign, the growth of digital in their marketing spends and how the brand measures the efficacy of their digital campaigns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When quizzed about what the genesis of the communication was, Kashikar said,&amp;nbsp;“India as a market has got tremendous opportunity. It is the fastest-growing economy in the world, fastest-growing middle-class in the world and the fastest-growing domestic aviation market. We thought that it is the perfect time to capitalise on the India-opportunity. To support that, we have had four consecutive years of double-digit growth on arrivals and spends and our market share has increased significantly. Also the Australian dollar is predictably stable as compared to other currencies. We thought of tapping into this particular potential."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He revealed that the Indian outbound travel market is surging ahead and it is one of the fastest-growing markets. “There is an untapped potential that exists. In order to increase the destination market share, we want to give people reasons to travel to Australia. However, we needed to bridge the gap between the intention to visit and actual visitation. There’s a conversion gap and how do you bridge that with compelling reasons for someone to visit Australia? By showcasing a part of Australia which is unexplored, unfamiliar and undiscovered,” explained Kashikar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He shared that the campaign will be a year-long initiative which will include a robust television campaign. Other plans include capitalising on the Indian cricket team’s tour to Australia by working closely with Sony and Sony LIV. “We have content-integration opportunities with platforms such as ESPN, Conde Nast Group and we’re also working with friends of Australia and influencers such as, Parineeti Chopra, Harsha Bhogle and Chef Sanjeev Kapoor. This will be further amplified on their digital platforms too,” he revealed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For this, Tourism Australia will also work closely with key distribution partners such as,  MakeMyTrip and SOTC, and will get influencers and celebrities to travel to Australia. ”Our focus is on attracting the high-value travel segment which could contribute significantly to the Australian economy. Banking partners help us target those affluent customers. We are also looking at some partnerships with Facebook and Google to target the specific demographics we want to reach,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kashikar also spoke about the growth of the brand’s spends on digital.” Digital is an important part of our marketing mix. We’ve seen our spends on digital media increase from 7 per cent in 2012 to 60 per cent in 2017. So there is definitely a shift on digital initiatives through integrated campaigns on search, social, display, natives, programmatic and re-targeting tools. We are also going to leverage the OTT platforms and are looking at television as a medium to drive this aspiration to travel to Australia.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When quizzed about the market challenges faced, he said, “Rather than demand-side challenges, we face a lot of supply-side challenges like the indirect distribution capacity from India to Australia which has been addressed with our recent initiatives of tie ups with eight&amp;nbsp;airlines for discounted fares.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kashikar opened up that they do a lot of work in the content-marketing space. ”For one of our campaigns, we recently hosted the top 50 food and wine influencers to Australia. This helped amplify our food and wine messaging across their social-media platforms and broadcast channels as well. So content-marketing is a key part of our digital marketing strategy,” he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He shared that the brand measures the efficacy of their digital campaigns by looking at various factors such as leads generated as a result of the campaign, average time spent on their website and more. “We ensure that the ROI for our campaign keeps increasing with every dollar that we spend."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

Read&amp;nbsp;succeeds Sir Martin Sorrell who moved out of the company in April this year. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the helm of the largest media company in the world at a time when the advertising world is experiencing a severe churn, Read will have to tackle the challenges of a changing ecosystem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Taking charge as the CEO, Read wrote an internal&amp;nbsp;mail&amp;nbsp;to all 1,30,000&amp;nbsp;WPP employees outlining his vision for the company. In the mail he said, “Our industry is going through a period of structural change, not structural decline, and if we embrace that change, we can look ahead to an exciting and successful future.” Read said although “some commentators have questioned the prospects for our industry,”&amp;nbsp;he believes that the “prospects are bright”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“What makes WPP special is its people,” he wrote. As WPP strengthens its offerings, Read said, the company will invest in areas that are reshaping the industry, like artificial intelligence and programmatic media. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the letter, he laid down the mission for WPP. The mission, he said, is “to build on our strengths, increase the pace of change, and release the full potential that exists within WPP for the benefit of our clients.” Doing so will get the company “in the best shape to deliver stronger growth for our share owners,” wrote Read. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With management consultancies encroaching upon the agency business, Read said the “spirit of creativity will always be at the heart of what we do, but pairing that with expertise in technology and data is vital.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the path ahead, he&amp;nbsp;said, “I see WPP as a modern, vibrant organisation that works as a team to help our clients succeed and grow through an integrated offer of marketing, consulting and technology services.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read added that WPP will simplify its offering to clients. “Access to our wealth of talent and resources will be even simpler for our clients. We’ll be absolutely focused on what our clients need, and we won’t let our own structures distract us or get in the way. As part of that simplification, we’ll adopt much more of a common approach to things like technology, data and production.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To help achieve all goals that he set for WPP, Read said the company&amp;nbsp;will “foster a culture that attracts the best and brightest: inclusive, respectful, collaborative, diverse.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Building the new WPP will be a shared endeavour and I’m looking forward to working with and listening to people throughout the company as we develop our plans for the future,” he further said. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to motivating employees and setting the tone for the next phase of WPP in the internally circulated mail, Read announced that Andrew Scott will take up the position of Chief Operating Officer of WPP on a permanent basis as a key member of the senior team.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company will announce its half-yearly financial results on September 4.</news:description>

      <news:title>Cipla ropes in Priyanka Chopra to spread awareness about asthma</news:title>
      <news:description>Actress Priyanka Chopra, who suffers from asthma, has partnered with Cipla Respiratory to create awareness about the condition and break the stigma surrounding its treatment. She has advocated timely intervention that can help one have a better quality of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An ad featuring Chopra showcased how the actress suffered from asthma but was able to fight it off with the help of Cipla. The ad drives home the message that you may have asthma but it doesn't control you, so live a 'Berok' life with the help of Cipla. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"As someone who is asthmatic, I can say that there is a social stigma associated with asthma and its therapy. It is evident that asthma is on the rise in India and there is little awareness about the most effective therapy on offer," Priyanka had said in a statement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As part of a campaign, Priyanka will help spread the word regarding the need for an attitudinal change towards inhalation therapy as the most effective for asthma management vis-a-vis oral medication. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nikhil Chopra, Head India Business, Cipla Ltd said “Cipla has always placed patient well-being at the core of all its initiatives and believed in a holistic approach to disease management. We are continuously working towards providing people with asthma the right treatment while ensuring every citizen is made aware about its long-term implications. Asthma is always easier to control when diagnosed earlier and when one consistently stays on a treatment plan. We are happy to partner with Priyanka Chopra, a super achiever, and an inspiration for many to help increase both relevance and acceptance of inhalation therapy thereby ensuring better follow-up with optimal outcomes for asthmatics. This association and the upcoming #BerokZindagi campaign for inhalation therapy directly resonates with our endeavor of enabling people with asthma to achieve more in their daily lives.</news:description>

      <news:title>Star Sports’ new TVC ‘Pange waala padosi’ magnifies spirited India-Pak rivalry  </news:title>
      <news:description>Star Sports, the official broadcaster of the Unimoni Asia Cup, has unveiled a new TVC as part of the ongoing #KnockThemOut campaign. The tournament is scheduled to begin on 15th September will see Asian neighbours take on each other.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Star Sports’ latest TVC, designed for India v Pakistan clash scheduled on 19th September, is a tongue-in-cheek take on how both the teams view each other as their fiercest on-field rival. Historically, India vs Pakistan cricket matches across formats have created some great significant moments, making it one of the biggest sporting rivalries in the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Staying true to it, and with a twist on an age-old ‘Neighbourhood Rivalry’, the film pits Omi Vaidya who plays the ‘Pange waala padosi’ and Naveen Kasturia who plays a newly moved in neighbour against each other. The two neighbours, a clever metaphor for the two teams, try to knockout each other during the course of the TVC making the Unimoni Asia Cup 2018 the quasi-battleground on which these two neighbours would want to settle scores and emerge triumphant. &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;The defending champions India will start off their campaign against the winner of the Asia Cup qualifier on 18th September before taking on their arch-rivals Pakistan on 19th September. The tournament guarantees a riveting battle for the Asian supremacy between these neighbours. Interestingly, given the format of the tournament, fans may witness possibly 3 India-Pakistan clashes in the tournament.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Fans can catch the Unimoni Asia Cup 2018 live on the Star Sports Network and Hotstar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twitter:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarSportsIndia/status/1035148464663851008" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://twitter.com/StarSportsIndia/status/1035148464663851008&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Facebook:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/starsportsindia/videos/2162138820731149/" rel="nofollow"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/starsportsindia/videos/2162138820731149/&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instagram:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BnGq3EmFttq/?taken-by=starsportsindia" rel="nofollow"&gt; https://www.instagram.com/p/BnGq3EmFttq/?taken-by=starsportsindia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YouTube:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E92VgDFvZLM" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Technology will secure the future of OOH: Chairman &amp; MD, Selvel One</news:title>
      <news:description>There are hardly any brands that do not advertise on OOH, says Noomi Mehta, Chairman and Managing Director of Selvel One. The new LED screens add the touch of glamour to a medium that has long been the workhorse of the advertising world, he says.&amp;nbsp;“Technology is a friend to OOH. It adds flexibility and gives a creative boost to the medium. Technology will secure the future of OOH around the world.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a conversation with exchange4media, Mehta talks about the various aspects of OOH advertising and why it is crucial for brands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edited excerpts:&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;What are your views on digital OOH? Do you think it will become a huge growth driver for the OOH industry?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;All over the world, digital has taken a disproportionate share of the OOH media pie. And this has not happened by cannibalising&amp;nbsp;the classic OOH media, but through a quantum jump in the share of OOH in the overall media pie. I see no reason why the India story should be any different. In fact, given the density of population in cities, the growth story should be even more dramatic. By and large, just&amp;nbsp;5 to 7 per cent of&amp;nbsp;digital OOH expenditure&amp;nbsp;is equivalent to&amp;nbsp;nearly&amp;nbsp;50 per cent of the total OOH expenditure. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What changes do you think technology will bring about in the OOH landscape?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technology has been a disruption for media. Newspapers and magazines all over the world have suffered a sharp decline in their hard copy formats and subsequently their advertising support, and have been forced to adapt IoT as they moved online. Television too has come under enormous pressure. Channels are suffering as players like Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, YouTube and Hotstar have become the preferred medium for viewing.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Technology is a friend to OOH. It adds flexibility, colour and immediacy via latest hardware and helps place advertisements better by automatically changing products and creatives to match the audience. It has given a creative boost to the medium.&amp;nbsp;Studies have shown that the efficacy of digital advertising increases substantially when bolstered by on OOH campaign. The medium cannot be zapped, switched or silenced as it cannot be manipulated by bots, clicks and automation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The efficiency of buying OOH has increased dramatically with the use of technology. Technology can give an idea of the reach, frequency and likelihood of seeing as cameras capture eye movements, pauses and even smiles when ads are viewed. Predictive analysis on movements, passageways and destinations make it possible to pinpoint the ads that have&amp;nbsp;actually influenced people&amp;nbsp;and contributed to sale. This gives the marketers an invaluable ally and tool in evaluating and allocating market spends. This may take a while to percolate into the Indian market, but when it does catch on, it will spread like wildfire. Yes, technology will secure the future of OOH around the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the OOH domain bringing more brands into its fold? What is your particular experience in this regard?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are hardly any brands that do not advertise on OOH. The new LED screens add the touch of glamour to a medium that has long been the workhorse of the advertising world. The final barrier of resistance to OOH will crumble with the drama, effect and impact that giant LED screens can provide. Once clients get to experience the effectiveness of the medium, the market will explode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think is the impact of advertising on the street?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact that all other media uses OOH&amp;nbsp;shows its impact. When you think of the world's largest brands, you automatically remember their OOH campaigns -- Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Google, Samsung, Apple, and Amazon. In fact, Netflix has bought off OOH companies along the West Coast of USA to advertise their own programmes! Need we say more?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does Selvel provide leverage to brands in terms of visibility, reach and recall?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Visibility and reach are in-built in every location that we own. Over the years, we have pioneered almost every size and format in OOH-- from monopoles to backlit, to halogen lighting and then to metal halides. We put up street lamps, created parks and even engineered and financed a traffic signal system in a major city. We pioneered LED screens 15 years ago to provide reach and visibility with a variety of options.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any challenges that you face in the Indian OOH scenario? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The problems we face are the same as others in different parts of the country. There is a belief that billboards cause danger to motorists. Sadly not a single study has ever proven any link, even casually, between OOH media and accidents. In fact, the major accidents in the country are on highways! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We at IOAA are trying to get a model code approved by the Ministry of Urban Affairs so that the basic guidelines can be universally adapted with changes for local peculiarities. Every municipal corporation interprets OOH differently with some by-laws that govern our business dating back to the days of our independence! And of course every commissioner who takes charge automatically knows everything there is to know about OOH without even bothering to study the industry. So changes keep happening in rules and regulations every time there is a change in the top executive of a municipal body. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;New OOH needs time and this requires stability and long-term contracts. Given proper encouragement, OOH can contribute substantially to the city infrastructure. We have already proven that we are better than the government in maintaining civic infrastructure entrusted to us on BOOT basis. Smart cities need smart OOH and that means large investments.</news:description>

      <news:description>Godrej Protekt, a range of hand hygiene products from Godrej Consumer Products Ltd, has unveiled a campaign for its recently-launched Protekt Mr. Magic, the first-ever powder to liquid handwash. It is a unique innovation in the world of handwashes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Protekt Mr. Magic is Godrej Protekt’s solution to making handwash accessible at Rs 15, to every home in India, with its affordable price point and innovative powder to liquid format. The magic powder, when mixed with 200 ml water, turns magically into a handwash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The TVC for Protekt Mr. Magic is conceptualised by Creativeland Asia. It communicates the innovation and the ease of making the handwash in an interesting way, through the TVC’s main protagonists – He is wondering how is she allowed to do all this, especially as parents these days are sceptical about letting their kids have this kind of fun fearing the risk of germs and diseases. The girl introduces him to Mr. Magic as a fun way to make handwash that lets kids be kids and provides protection from germs at extremely affordable price points. The TVC highlights that Protekt Mr. Magic is an enabler that allows everyone to explore the world without the fear of germs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the product, Sunil Kataria, CEO – India &amp;amp; SAARC, Godrej Consumer Products Limited (GCPL), said, “Perception of liquid handwash being expensive is a major reason behind many households not adopting the category. We have always dreamt of a future where every home will be able to afford a liquid handwash. Protekt Mr. Magic, the first-ever powder to liquid handwash, is infused with natural ingredients like Neem and Aloe Vera. With the germicidal properties of neem and the goodness of Aloe Vera, the product is soft on hands and tough on germs. Protekt Mr. Magic’s disruptive pricing of Rs 15 will make it easy for Indian households across segments and geographies to adopt this innovative format for a hygienic lifestyle.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the TVC, Anu Joseph, Chief Creative Officer, Creativeland Asia, says, “There are so many new things rolled into this revolutionary hand wash. And we had to tell the world about all of it. The fact that it is a DIY product, how to make it, what it is made of, how affordable it is, and of course, what it all means. The TVC does that with considerable ease and makes the point with great charm. All of it while maintaining the brand’s established tonality."   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Protekt Mr. Magic is available in a single powder sachet and also in a combi pack comprising Protekt Mr. Magic empty bottle and powder sachet. The powder sachet is priced at Rs.15, which is one-third the cost of existing liquid handwash refills. This can potentially reduce consumers current expense on handwashing soaps estimated at Rs.30 to half. The combi pack is priced at Rs.35. This is less than half the price of current liquid handwash bottle packs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Godrej Properties offers home buyers affordable EMIs with its #Happy EMIs campaign</news:title>
      <news:description>Godrej Properties Ltd, one of India’s leading real estate developers launched month-long comprehensive 360-degree campaign #HappyEMIs targeting the aspirations of young home buyers in India. The campaign is underway currently and will conclude - on 15th September 2018. Under this new campaign, home buyers can pay a pre-EMI starting Rs. 9999 per month for a limited period and book their dream home with Godrej Properties. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign uses affordable EMIs as the core proposition to reach its target audience. The #HappyEMIs campaign highlights the quandary of young home buyers who wish to own their dream homes but are apprehensive due to high EMIs. However, home buyers will now be able to own their dream homes with affordable pre-EMIs in comparison to the cost of several lifestyle accentuating products.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign is being leveraged across all media platforms including, digital video, print, out of home, radio and social media. Under the campaign, two digital videos have been released which reinstate how #HappyEMIs of the dream home is now less than the cost of a new smartphone, less than rental payment, EMI of a car and less than the last minute flight ticket. Both the videos assert how there are few bigger joys than having a home to call your own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the first video, one friend informs another that he has bought a new car to alleviate his lifestyle and societal status. The friends are then seen discussing how the friend actually wanted to buy his dream home but was apprehensive about paying high EMIs on home which would have severely impacted his financial independence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xt1k3fUBdo0" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the second video, a wife gifts her husband a high-end smartphone on their upcoming marriage anniversary. She informs her husband that she bought the gift in advance because of a lucrative deal. The husband surprises her by informing that he is contemplating booking a home with Godrej Properties under the #HappyEMIs campaign as the pre-EMI is less than that of the smartphone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E7ZpazrYzMY" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 360-degree campaign also encompasses a digital video with millennial-focused lifestyle YouTube channel, Timeliners targets young couples who are in dilemma of whether to have a child or not because of the rising costs of living. See the video:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZ-eouaSVds" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Elaborating on the campaign, Lalit Makhijani, CMO, Godrej Properties Ltd., said, “This campaign is thoughtfully aligned with India’s 72nd Independence Day where we want to reach out to the aspirational homebuyers who desire a high standard of living, and not settle for anything less. With this campaign, we aim to offer young homebuyers with financial independence by investing in their dream homes, while thoughtfully balancing the burden of paying rent and hefty EMIs. #HappyEMIs is currently activated at our 22 project locations across 6 cities in India. We are optimistic that with #Happy EMIs campaign, we would be able to persuade those who have been postponing their decisions because they were apprehensive about the affordability of their dream home.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the idea behind the campaign, Shounak Guhathakurta, Senior Creative Director, JWT Mumbai said, "A simple and effective idea above all else. EMIs are a dreaded thing. The expression of #HappyEMIs put that notion to rest. At Rs.9999 a month, it was comparable to what people pay as rent or the cost of their next smartphone. The campaign pretty much wrote itself from there and especially worked well with consumers facing an all too common dilemma; to buy or to rent."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Buying a home has become a distant dream for young millennials considering the rising home prices and the housing market which is making it increasingly difficult for them to make a purchase decision. With this campaign, young home buyers who are keen to buy property in luxury projects by Godrej Properties can finally fulfill their dream.</news:description>

      <news:title>Cricket is almost an independent medium for us now: Jaskaran Kapany, Paytm</news:title>
      <news:description>In India, cricket is more than just a sport; it is akin to a religion. Each cricket game or tournament that features India finds almost the entire nation glued to the&amp;nbsp;TV screens with bated breath. It is, therefore, no surprise that all brands looking to create an impact and recall value associate with the sport. Several brands have actually launched themselves on the back of cricket tournaments, and some have even seen a huge growth and&amp;nbsp;recall with cricket-centric campaigns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Asia Cup is round the corner and there is a prospect of arch rivals India and Pakistan taking on one another on the pitch. We talk to Jaskaran Kapany, Vice-President, Marketing, Paytm, to get their perspective on marketing and advertising during cricket tournaments. Read on to know his advice on how brands can get maximum ROI &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;guaranteed eyeballs  from a cricketing association,&amp;nbsp;and also his favourite  India-Pakistan game moments: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How impactful is cricket as a vehicle for brand building? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;If done well, cricket can give an immensely different stature to a brand. There is nothing bigger than cricket in India. It is like a religion and undoubtedly the most followed sport, across geographies, with an unparalleled reach. Not only this, it has a unique position in the minds of consumers. It is mass and at the same time premium. Hence, it delivers phenomenal perceived value for a brand. For Paytm, cricket has worked exceptionally well and it is almost an independent medium for us now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take us through some of your recent cricket-based campaigns. How have they worked out for Paytm? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We have the unique distinction of being long-term ‘on-ground’ partner with both BCCI India cricket since 2015 and now with the IPL for five years. Over the years, we have done many innovative on-ground activations ranging from the ‘Paytm se Stadium’ initiative wherein Paytm customers had a chance to get their shopping packages ‘delivered’ by leading Indian cricket players before the match, to the innovative 'Digital Money Transfer’ and the ‘Man of the Match’. Our recent giant screen QR code initiative also did very well for the brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can brands do to derive greater ROI from cricket campaigns?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Brands must create and deliver compelling propositions in ways that break the clutter. Else, it is easy to be swept away in the sea of clutter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can brands leverage India-Pakistan rivalry to its maximum?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Amongst other things, brands chase audiences or reach. Without a shadow of a doubt, India-Pakistan clashes are known to garner maximum eyeballs on TV. Looking at facts, the India-Pak ODI match in the 2017 Champions Trophy garnered over a 200 million eyeballs. Now, if you add consumer passion on top of these eyeballs, it becomes a very impactful and premium TV property that any brand would want to be a part of.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your favourite India–Pakistan moment?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;There are many. Who can forget Venkatesh Prasad’s royal send off to Aamir Sohail in the 1996 World Cup! And more recently, India’s win in the inaugural T20 World tournament in 2007, with just 6 runs to go off 4 balls. Misbah mistimed his shot to land India a thrilling victory! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the standard of cricket has improved among Asian countries?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;South Asia boasts of some serious cricketing nations. India, Sri Lanka and Pakistan have all won World Cups in the past and hence the quality of sport is extremely competitive in this part of the world. Within these, India obviously is clearly leading the way and has delivered a world-class exhibition of sports and talent development over the years.</news:description>

      <news:title>Eureka Forbes launches new 'Har Water Purifier Aquaguard Nahi Hota’ ad campaign&#13;
&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>Eureka Forbes Limited, the makers of Aquaguard, has launched a new campaign under the name ‘Har Water Purifer Aquaguard Nahi Hota’. Since its inception, Aquaguard has been synonymous with water purifiers in India through its innovations and many industry firsts to its credit.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the past three decades, the brand has successfully retained its leadership position by relentlessly introducing new technologies to address changing customer needs and environmental conditions. With several patented technologies such as, Biotron, Nutritron &amp;amp; Mineral Guard to its name, Aquaguard also has the largest service network in its category.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While many new players have entered the market, none have been able to match product features, technology, reliability, trust and after sales service of Aquaguard. To the extent that when customers walk into a restaurant, the term ‘Aquaguard’ is commonly used as a synonym for drinking ‘water’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aquaguard is the only water purifier brand to invest in research and development on varying water conditions in over 7000 pin codes of India and developed 21 water purification technologies to combat 21 different water conditions. It has received more than 130 certifications by leading water laboratories all over the world and has been conferred with numerous Indian and international awards for its superior technology. Aquaguard is looking at ensuring that its consumers are well-informed about the right technologies and products best suited for their individual needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through the TVC, the company aims to educate and create awareness among consumers and focus on the need of healthy drinking water for an individual’s holistic growth, while also letting people know that every water purifier may not provide the benefits that an Aquaguard can. As a part of this campaign, a young couple, will be seen highlighting the differentiation and impact that the new technology will have on human body and the need to drink healthy water. The campaign has been creatively planned by Taproot Dentsu and will be launched across all media channels and platforms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Being a leader in the water purification category, Aquaguard’s new campaign is yet another aggressive move wherein the brand aims to highlight the clear differentiation created through its innovative technologies to the life of the consumer and strengthen the preference for the brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sharing his thoughts on the announcement, Marzin R. Shroff, CEO, Eureka Forbes Limited said, “Over the last 3 decades, Eureka Forbes has continuously introduced new technologies and solutions to address the changing consumer needs. With growing competition and existence of unorganized players in the market, the brand as the leader has always ensured that its consumers are well informed about the right technologies and have provided products that are best suited for their individual needs. Through the launch of ‘Har Water Purifer Aquaguard Nahi Hota’ campaign, we will continue our efforts to build a stronger and healthier India and aim to create a meaningful difference to the lives of the consumers thereby promoting healthy living.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the campaign, Agnello Dias, Chief Creative Office, Taproot Dentsu said  “Eureka Forbes &amp;amp; Aquaguard are two of the most iconic names in water purification and this campaign only drives home that point - that there can be various ways of purifying your water, but there is none like Aquaguard. It's a powerful position for the brand to take and one that is rightfully theirs.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the campaign will have a series of videos, here is the video to the first TVC:  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Decathlon India partners with Social Kinnect to launch #PlayFor campaign</news:title>
      <news:description>In the hustle and bustle of daily life and with the rise of technology, people across age groups have been spending less time on sporting activities each year. While it is still considered an important part of a child’s life, fewer adults take up sports as a form of recreation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There are several reasons why people give up their play times. From work timings, to deficits in energy, the decreasing possibility of the moment of victory, or the inability to play due to the lack of space around them, each person has their own specific reason.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This National Sports Day, Decathlon India wanted to change the way people looked at sports and inspire them to get back on the field in however small a way they could. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To do this, digital marketing agency, Social Kinnect, conceptualised and brought to life the first of its kind #PlayFor campaign which reminded everyone that playing wasn’t just about winning and it was playing itself that brought joy to people in several different ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creating a movement, Decathlon brought out the various emotions tied back to sports. From creating memories to moments of celebration, fun and banter, sports had the power to bring smiles to people’s faces no matter how strenuous it might have been. And to add to the charm of it, all the people you will see in the video are Decathlon team members.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To ensure the video was seen by the masses and the whole country could draw inspiration from it, the video was replicated across 7 major languages spoken in the country. English, Hindi, Bengali, Kannada, Telugu and Tamil videos were created and populated across channels to reach the largest audience possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through this video, you will experience a series of emotions as you watch moments of strain and moments of immense joy experienced in each sport. Let it take over you and inspire you to join the movement and get back to sports.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Watch the campaign video here: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Zirca launches ContentiQ enabling marketers to leverage the power of content intelligence</news:title>
      <news:description>Zirca Digital Solutions launched its second proprietary product ContentiQ, which combines the power of audience profiling and content consumption data to help media planners and advertisers create strategic insights-driven and data-informed content plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ContentiQ leverages Zirca’s proprietary content intelligence to reveal unique insights about a marketer’s target audience and equips marketers with deeper insights into audience archetypes by highlighting personality traits, interests and motivations—all important drivers of digital/online behaviour. The tool provides media planners and advertisers with relevant content categories, types and format preferences based on these consumer archetypes. These insights will prove critical for creating and publishing content on relevant digital channels.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Content serves as the bridge between marketers and their consumers. With ContentiQ, we are bringing science to content creation so that media planners and advertisers can offer powerful audience-centric content based on psychographics. This tool is set to revolutionize the content planning landscape in India and globally,” says Zirca CEO Neena Dasgupta.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“In a rapidly-evolving content industry, marketers need to realize that their audience is not just a number.

      <news:title>Zee TV shows do not shift focus from middle-class related issues: Aparna Bhosle&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>Aparna Bhosle was&amp;nbsp;recently appointed as new business head of Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd's&amp;nbsp;(ZEEL) flagship Hindi general entertainment channel, Zee TV. Bhosle has been with Zee&amp;nbsp;since 2012 having joined the network in&amp;nbsp;2012 as business head of ZeeQ and Zee Anmol.&amp;nbsp;Before moving to the new role, she was heading&amp;nbsp;ZEEL’s English channels cluster. In an exclusive conversation with exchange4media, Bhosle talks about her new role and challenges.&amp;nbsp;Excerpts:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On her new role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Within Zee, I have handled very different businesses (over the years). I started with kids channels,&amp;nbsp;which could be 10 to 75 towns and urban, largely. Later I&amp;nbsp;shifted to ZEEL’s free to air (FTA) channel, which was completely different from the&amp;nbsp;kids space. Running Zee Anmol, which was largely rural, takes a lot of understanding as well. After that, we got Big Magic, which was another ball game so I&amp;nbsp;handled that as well. Therefore, if you look at it, running a business is largely managing a P&amp;amp;L, so whatever may be the content offering of the channel, technically my job still stays the same. I have to just understand the scale of the business and how to manage the numbers to keep it all going. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Challenges across HGEC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It's only one week&amp;nbsp;that I have taken the mandate. I am spending much time observing everything. These two launches (new shows Tujhse Hai Raabta and Guddan Tumse Na Ho Paayega),&amp;nbsp;were&amp;nbsp;largely worked on by&amp;nbsp;Deepak (Rajadhyaksha,&amp;nbsp;former business head of Zee TV). Starting this&amp;nbsp;month, we will figure out what strategy should be applicable&amp;nbsp;going forward. Currently we are set between 9pm to 10.30 pm. We have good shows in the&amp;nbsp;same time slot, there is&amp;nbsp;Kundali Bhagya, Kumkum Bhagya and Ishq Subhan Allah and they are all performing very well. The next time slot that we worked on was to have&amp;nbsp;these two shows between 8pm-9pm. Therefore, now how I take the business that has been handed over to me to newer heights is what my job is all about. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content on Zee TV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you look at all the other channels, everyone is trying different things. The thing about Zee is that the channel is rooted to&amp;nbsp;issues related to the middle class. We don’t move away&amp;nbsp;from that. We have a giant research engine, as in we have an&amp;nbsp;in-house insight team. Ongoing work is to reach out&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;different cities all over the country to gather&amp;nbsp;insights from real people and empowered women. We dealt with triple talaq through Ishq Subhan Allah, which was such a&amp;nbsp;topical issue. So&amp;nbsp;largely listening to the audience and then designing and identifying shows which relate with them is&amp;nbsp;the strength of Zee TV. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whats’ next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is too early to comment. The first thing I will do is to identify the most apt time slot for the shows which are already in the process. This is largely an FCP management game, of course from April 2019, when we will have more shows,&amp;nbsp;I will be working closely with my fiction team.</news:description>

      <news:title>PHD appoints Dipika Bhasin as Delhi Head, elevates Anuj Madan as Delhi Digital Lead</news:title>
      <news:description>PHD India has strengthened its leadership team in Delhi to accommodate the demands of growth from North India, including Vivo’s digital mandate win&amp;nbsp;earlier this year. The agency has appointed Dipika Bhasin as Head of the Delhi office while Anuj Madan has been elevated as the Delhi Digital Lead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhasin brings with her over 17 years of experience, joining from sister agency Omnicom Media Group (OMD) where she spent six years and most recently served as the Vice President for the Delhi office. Prior to joining OMD in 2011, Bhasin developed extensive media experience through roles at Zee Telefilms, Carat and Aircel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madan is an award-winning digital professional with well-rounded experience in transforming digital businesses for brands such as Renault, HP India, Samsung, Amex, Lufthansa and Swatch over the last 12 years. Prior to joining OMD in 2015, Madan served as a Business Director at Cheil Worldwide and Mindshare, leading their digital business. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the development, Jyoti Kumar Bansal, CEO of PHD India, said, “The appointments reflect the growing demands of our clients based in North India and the volume of activity the Delhi office now manages, especially after the Vivo digital account win and the growth in mandates from HP, SC Johnson and other clients. With Dipika’s deep-rooted knowledge of the North India market and how to make brands thrive there and&amp;nbsp;Anuj’s digital prowess, I am confident that we will continue to see more impressive wins come out of our office in Delhi.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the new role, Bhasin said, “PHD has demonstrated impressive growth, having been recognised as Campaign’s Agency of the Year last year and won prominent international and local businesses in the recent years. I am excited to be joining the team and continuing the momentum in Delhi and North India.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Madan said, “It’s been great to have played a part in PHD’s growth journey in Delhi during my role at Omnicom Media Group, with the recent Vivo win being a testament to the agency’s superior digital offering in the market. I look forward to working with Vivo and our other clients in North India on raising their digital credentials and driving real business performance for them.”</news:description>

      <news:title>Vodafone Idea Limited: A lesson in merging dissimilar brands</news:title>
      <news:description>If you have ever mixed red and yellow water colours together you would have known that orange would feature in Vodafone Idea Limited’s colour palette. Although the two brands will stay separate under the newly merged company, Vodafone’s rich red and Idea Cellular’s bright yellow have been mixed together to create the colour palette for the new company. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The merger of the two companies which has dislodged Airtel as the leading telecom operator in the country is a lesson on how to tackle a merger involving dissimilar brands. Media reports said that the CMO of VIL, Sashi Shankar, joked that he would not mind a Zoozoo saying “What an Idea, Sirjee.” From all the indications the brand has given out so far, the Idea and Vodafone brands will stay at an arm’s distance from each other, and experts say that’s the best way to do it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both Vodafone and Idea Cellular have built unique brand identities targeting a very different kind of audience through their communication. Vodafone has built brand affinity based on a premium positioning with the pug at first, then the Zoozoos, and more recently the gracefully aging Asha-Bala couple touring the world. Idea Cellular on the other hand spoke to a less urban class of users telling them that a phone number is as good as a name and is a unique identifier.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While many were expecting a unification of the brands itself, experts feel that keeping the brands separate under the umbrella company is a good start. “Both the brands have distinct competencies, one is urban and the other is rural. Therefore, it is good to keep the brands separate because rural folk mostly like to emote with older brands they have been with for a long period of time,” said Harish Bijoor, CEO, Harish Bijoor Consults. He felt that had the brands been merged, the brand would neither have an upmarket imagery nor a downmarket imagery and would end up alienating existing consumers. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bobby Pawar, MD and CCO, Publicis Worldwide, said that in a merger of this kind, bringing together brands that are figuratively poles apart is a challenging problem. Telecom is a commodity service, he pointed out, “so the only differentiator you have is the brand.” Her further added, “People buy into the idea of one brand and if that brand changes its identity it is hard to say how they would react.” Therefore toying around with merging the brands to create a Frankenstein should be avoided at all costs he felt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most crucial in a merger of this kind would be for the brands to set the tone for the new company. “They need to clear their heads and decide what they want the brand to be, who they are internally, and where they stand. This is not easy, it is going to be tough journey ahead,” said Santosh Padhi, CCO and Co-founder, Taproot Dentsu. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore, the best strategy is to keep everything consumer facing the same for now. "The customer wasn't top of mind when this merger was conceived. It's all about cost optimisation and the bottomline, so there will of course be media buying and procurement synergies.  But with two strong brands in their stable, each with massively iconic advertising, we won't be seeing much change at a consumer level for the foreseeable future," felt Roopak Saluja, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, The 120 Media Collective.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the brand campaign for VIL launches two weeks from now, it will be clearer how deep the colour orange goes and what tone VIL takes. Ogilvy India is said to be working on the campaign that will launch VIL soon. A highly placed source has confirmed that the campaign will establish VIL as the parent company for Vodafone and Idea.</news:description>

      <news:title>The objective is to ensure larger good of the sector: NP Singh, President, IBF</news:title>
      <news:description>It was announced last week that&amp;nbsp;NP Singh, CEO &amp;amp; MD of Sony Pictures Networks India (SPN) had been elected as the new President of the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF)&amp;nbsp;at their 19th Annual General Meeting.&amp;nbsp;He will succeed Punit Goenka, Managing Director, Zee Entertainment Enterprises Limited. Goenka's term had come to an end.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While, Prasar Bharati CEO Shashi Shekhar Vempati has been elected as the Director of IBF Board, all other office-bearers of the Foundation have been re-elected. However, appointed member Girish Srivastava, Secretary General, IBF, stepped down from his position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on his election as IBF president, Singh said, “I am elated to lead IBF at a crucial juncture and will put my best efforts to make the sector invigorating. A strong media and broadcast sector will not only serve as the conscience-keeper of the nation but will educate, entertain and acclimatise the masses. My key objective would be to ensure the larger good of the sector in keeping with the regulatory practices.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Singh, as an industry veteran who rose from the post of CFO of SPN in 1999 to CEO in 2014 will have several&amp;nbsp;major challenges as President of the IBF.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One of the key challenges&amp;nbsp;will be to keep broadcasters relevant in the environment where&amp;nbsp;digital is growing rapidly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“There was a discussion in the Annual General Meeting on what could the broadcasting industry do to keep itself relevant in times when content is easily available on mobile. Everyone agrees that there is demand on more content among the audience but the problem will be in holding the audience before the television box,” a well-connected source informed exchange4media.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Former IBF President, Punit Goenka, said, “Singh has always been a supportive colleague on the Board and his broad insight and acumen will help us deal with the challenges that the sector is facing today.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Singh brings with him over 35 years of varied experience in the corporate world and in his current role, he is focused on building leadership equity of SPNI. During his long innings at SPN, he has also served as its Chief Operating Officer (COO). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Before joining SPN in 1999, he held several leadership positions across Finance and Operations in leading organisations including Modi Xerox and Spice Telecom. He also serves as a Director on the Board of Bangla Entertainment Private Limited and Broadcast Audience Research Council (BARC), India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An alumnus of the Delhi School of Economics, where he completed his master programme, Singh holds a bachelor degree in commerce from the University of Delhi. A rank holder of the Institute of Cost Accountants of India, Singh was honored with a Certificate of Merit by the Institute for his meritorious performance.</news:description>

      <news:title>TRAI deadline on tariff order ends, but broadcasters waiting for Sept 5 SC hearing </news:title>
      <news:description>On July 3, 2018, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) gave a 60-day deadline to broadcasters for publication of Reference Interconnect Offer, declaration of MRP and nature of channels, in connection with its tariff order. The deadline came to an end on August 31, 2018, but broadcasters are yet to comply with the order and the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable) Interconnection (Addressable Systems) Regulations, 2017.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a hearing on the issue&amp;nbsp;on August 27, but the Supreme Court deferred it to September 5, 2018. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the implementation of the order, Sudhanshu Vats, Managing Director, Viacom18, told exchange4media, that it is a “good thing” but "they have to find out the right ways to operationalise it."&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“We are working on our response to the tariff order. It's premature to comment on it specifically. It is still sub-judice in some way because there is another hearing in SC on September 5 and then in Delhi High Court as well. So, these two things are happening simultaneously. Like other players in the industry, you will see our response depending on how SC hearing goes.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“At a certain conceptual level, it's a good thing to do, but we have to find out the right ways to operationalise it. You can’t disagree on the principle of giving more choice to the consumers and letting them pick and choose. It's a right thing to do,” he added.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the same lines, the legal head of a leading broadcaster said that most players in the industry are waiting for the September 5 hearing. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"Everyone is waiting for September 5 (for the Supreme Court’s hearing). Some broadcasters have complied with the tariff order, but with a disclaimer stating ‘subject to the outcome of this case’,” the legal head said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After the apex court deferred the hearing to September 5, ZEEL announced that it was "planning multiple bouquets in each language.” But ZEEL’s announcement was mostly about ‘plans’ that it is ‘likely’ to implement. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sources in the industry told exchange4media that “it is very likely that broadcasters will request the TRAI to extend the deadline.” Some sources also hinted that one of the petitioners has already written to the TRAI for this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Madras High Court on May 23, 2018 upheld the validity of the tariff order and the Telecommunication (Broadcasting and Cable) Interconnection (Addressable Systems) Regulations, 2017, in general.&amp;nbsp;Post this order, TRAI on July 3, 2018 published a press note bringing the tariff order, as upheld by the Madras High Court, into effect with separate timelines for different requirements. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, in the press note, TRAI did not mention the steps it would take if the stakeholders failed to meet the deadline. exchange4media spoke to various senior players in the broadcasting industry and some legal heads of channels and almost all of them said that TRAI has left it open ended by not mentioning the action it would take if the deadline was not met.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;exchange4media repeatedly tried to speak to TRAI over the issue but did not get a response till the filing of the article.</news:description>

      <news:title>Motorola celebrates #SuperSisters with a digital campaign</news:title>
      <news:description>Motorola’s digital campaign #SuperSisters brings to life the emotional bond between brother and sister. Created by Enormous Brands the video campaign represents the brother-sister relationship in a refreshing manner and focused on the fact that a sister’s protection is just as powerful as that of a brother’s. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Breaking away from the stereotype of “brother protects sister”, the campaign empowers all those super sisters who have stood up against this stereotype and have always been a strength for their brothers, which has been depicted through a 45 seconds short film.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign film introduced a unique twist to the usual Raksha Bandhan story, where a brother is expected to gift his sister something with a promise of always protecting her. However, this time the sister gifts him a brand-new Motorola phone, leaving him puzzled. Clearing out his confusion, the sister tells him that she has gifted him a phone so that he can call her if anyone troubles him in the hostel which takes him to the memory lane where his super sister has always looked out for him and protected him like a shield.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Harsh Maheshwari, Senior Creative Director, Enormous Brands LLP said, “Whoever has had the good fortune of growing up with a sister knows how sisters are. Loving, caring, a little annoying but always looking out for you. They have probably protected you from a lot of things. Like from getting bullied in school, from dad’s scolding, from wearing that ugly pair of jeans you thought were cool. We just wanted to write a little thank you note to all those super sisters from Motorola. And what better day to do that than Rakhshabandhan, right?”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rachna Lather, Marketing Head, Motorola Mobility added, “The #SuperSisters campaign aptly expresses the resilient spirit of sisters and highlights the essence of Rakshabandhan in the true sense. We wanted to celebrate all those strong women out there who have always stood by, supported and protected their brothers despite of the ‘brother protects sister’ stereotype, just like a super sister. With this film, we aimed to strike an emotional chord with our consumers and I am confident that the youth of India would have found resonance with the film.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The film was released across social media and video platforms garnering a reach of over 6mn views.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FMotorolaIN%2Fvideos%2F2031927536850699%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=476" width="476" height="476" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Breaks with KitKat get a surprisingly delightful twist in this latest campaign&#13;
&#13;
</news:title>
      <news:description>For many years, KitKat has established the importance of taking a break from the grind. Through its iconic campaigns, KitKat encourages young people to enjoy break moments which bring a smile to their face. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brand ambassadors, Sanya Malhotra and Fatima Sana Sheikh give a new meaning to the concept of breaks with the latest KitKat campaign ‘Karo jo karna hai, break mein banta hai’.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The brand new campaign ‘Karo jo karna hai, break mein banta hai’ reiterates the importance of breaks in our lives, and encourages us to not have a fear of judgements in our breaks. The campaign urges the youth to free themselves from any kind of expectations and to express their individuality freely, especially in their break moments.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the campaign, Nikhil Chand, General Manager, Chocolate and Confectionery, Nestlé India, said, “In today’s times, the clutter of modern day life puts continuous pressure on youngsters for being judged at all times, even during their breaks. This year, our new KitKat campaign ‘Karo jo karna hai, break mein banta hai’ is a reminder for people to enjoy their breaks without any pressure and fear of judgement.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Expressing her excitement on the campaign, Sanya Malhotra, said, “KitKat is my favourite break time treat. Today’s lives are fast paced and everyone needs a break. For me, just snapping a crispy KitKat finger in my breaks, doubles the fun of breaks.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the campaign, actor Fatima Sana Sheikh, said, “Even as actors, expectations and judgements surround us and we constantly try to balance our lives between what we like and what others ask us to do. KitKat's latest campaign ‘Karo jo karna hai, break mein banta hai’ is a refreshing reminder to have fun and be ourselves atleast in our breaks!” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See the campaign video here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

</news:title>
      <news:description>The past week saw many interesting developments as companies seem to be in the pitching mood, with the total value of the accounts for which pitches have been called this year so far standing at around Rs 4,000 crore, and includes big brands such Vivo, Samsung, GSK, Mondelez and Lenovo+ Motorola.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After Radhikha Apte and her continued collaboration with Netflix was trolled on the Internet with a series of memes, Netflix this week released a fake video and a movie poster called ‘Omnipresent’ as a humorous response to the trolls, giving rise to the 'Apt Hai' trend. This led to brands including Zomato, CEAT Tyres and KFC capitalising on the trend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week also saw several appointments and people movement announcements. Guy Hearn has been named as OMD's Chief Product Officer, APAC, while Unilever's Geetu Verma is all set to take up her new overseas role as Vice President, Nutrition &amp;amp; Natural Platforms. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gurmeet Singh stepped down as Vice President and Managing Director of Yahoo India, while NP Singh, Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Sony Pictures Networks has been elected as the new President of the Indian Broadcasting Foundation (IBF) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We also learnt this week that advertising giant WPP is all poised to announce the appointment of Mark Read as its new CEO after the exit of Sir Martin Sorrell.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read more on these stories here:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In The ‘Pitching Season’, Media Business Worth Rs 4,000 Crore Change Hands&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.exchange4media.com/advertising/in-the-pitching-season-media-business-worth-rs-4000-crore-change-hands_91797.html"&gt;https://www.exchange4media.com/advertising/in-the-pitching-season-media-business-worth-rs-4000-crore-change-hands_91797.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Apte!: Netflix, Radhika Apte And The Art Of Stopping Memes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.exchange4media.com/digital/how-apte-netflix-radhika-apte-and-the-art-of-stopping-memes_91800.html"&gt;https://www.exchange4media.com/digital/how-apte-netflix-radhika-apte-and-the-art-of-stopping-memes_91800.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OMNIPRESENT: CEAT Tyres, Zomato, KFC Join The 'Apt Hai' Netflix Bandwagon&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.exchange4media.com/digital/omnipresent-ceat-tyres-zomato-kfc-join-the-apt-hai-netflix-bandwagon_91845.html"&gt;https://www.exchange4media.com/digital/omnipresent-ceat-tyres-zomato-kfc-join-the-apt-hai-netflix-bandwagon_91845.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OMG Names Guy Hearn As Chief Product Officer-APAC&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.exchange4media.com/marketing/omd-names-guy-hearn-as-chief-product-officer-apac_91764.html"&gt;https://www.exchange4media.com/marketing/omd-names-guy-hearn-as-chief-product-officer-apac_91764.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unilever’s Geetu Verma To Take Up Overseas Role As VP, Nutrition &amp;amp; Natural Platforms&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.exchange4media.com/marketing/unilevers-geetu-verma-to-take-up-overseas-role-as-vp-nutrition-natural-platforms_91772.html"&gt;https://www.exchange4media.com/marketing/unilevers-geetu-verma-to-take-up-overseas-role-as-vp-nutrition-natural-platforms_91772.html&lt;br&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gurmit Singh Steps Down As VP And MD Of Yahoo!

      <news:title>Weekends are about reading, family time &amp; meeting friends: CEO, Sakal Media Group</news:title>
      <news:description>From reading newspapers to his vast and ever growing collection of books without interruption, Pradeep Dwivedi, Chief Executive Officer, Sakal Media Group prefers weekends at home with his family. He is a self-proclaimed foodie across genres both domestic and exotic, and is especially partial to desserts. He wants to learn the subtle art of great cooking even if it is for one or two signature dishes. Read on to find out more about Dwivedi and his weekend life: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On a typical weekend you will find me...&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;Getting up early to make that special cup of tea for my wife. Reading over a dozen newspapers for content and not just scanning them for advertisements carried and missed. Catching up on sleep or friends and typically planning the week ahead. Occasional outings in the city with family or to my mum’s house at Chandigarh is also interspersed in this.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My idea of relaxing is...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading my vast and ever growing collection of books without interruption, though I must admit that it is not always easy to do so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One vice I cannot do without... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following US politics on TV/ Web/Apps and pretty much everywhere else&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1535774850_1tQNKu_Pradeep_Dwivedi_1.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love a Staycation/adventure...&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br&gt;I truly enjoy staycations where you allow the location to slowly soak in and be one with. I enjoy eating the local food at local joints, and talking to residents and discovering sights that are off the regular tourist trail. As a family, we typically do not like very rushed vacations in which you would pack too much, leaving little time to build memories for a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I confess, I am a...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Foodie across genres both domestic and exotic. I plead guilty to being especially partial to desserts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I spend me-time on...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Social networks, especially Twitter, following a lot of professional colleagues and personal friends. Engaging with the wide diversity of thought and opinions of people especially over a nice cup of coffee is more addictive stimulant, than any other alternate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The last show I binge watched...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, I would like to join the crowd and shout out Sacred Games on NetFlix! While both actors Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Saif Ali Khan acted superbly and it had great direction, my very dear friend, Kubbra Sait literally took the cake with her outstanding and pivotal performance. It was simply awesome!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can make a mean ... to save my life...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Maggi Masala, I confess. For a foodie, I have been very recalcitrant in actually donning the apron. I guess that it is something I should take time out for, in the coming days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1535774850_h1GFbK_Pradeep_Dwivedi_2.jpg"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A skill/hobby I want to learn this year..&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;The subtle art of great cooking, even if it is for one or two signature dishes. My superbly talented wife, Deepti, has spoilt me thoroughly with her culinary skills and perhaps it is time I return the favour, albeit in a limited way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My next vacation/adventure will be...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a family, we’ve been planning a long US vacation spanning both coasts, and meeting friends, family, and adventures undiscovered for some time now. This has so far not fructified with school and college calendar constraints of our two daughters gaining priority. Hopefully, we shall plan it in the coming year.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In immediate future, I have an IAA Global Conference coming up in Bucharest, Romania, a city/country I have never visited before, so it should be very interesting.</news:description>

      <news:title>Varun Dhawan is the new brand ambassador for Resiquick Adhesive</news:title>
      <news:description>Resiquick, the new instant adhesive&amp;nbsp;brand from Astral Adhesives, has launched a new campaign developed by Lowe Lintas Ahmedabad. Varun Dhawan is the brand ambassador for Resiquick, promoting the adhesive brand in a multi-film campaign.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking on the campaign, Kairav Engineer, VP – Business Development, Astral Poly Technik said, “Our association with Varun Dhawan for the instant adhesive range is in sync with our brand ethos and identity, which is to innovate and introduce newer products that surprise and delight both, our trade and consumer. It is for the first time in the segment that a brand ambassador is signed on for a Cyanoacrylate-based instant adhesive product, and we are confident that Varun is a perfect fit with his on-screen and off-screen persona”.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The multi-film campaign shows how using a glue that spills can land people in tricky and sticky situations. Varun Dhawan introduces the audience to the hero of the film - Resiquick adhesive, pronouncing its unique benefit of '1 drop at a time' for ease of use and the strong bond it provides with the tagline 'sirf chipkao nahi, jodo'.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Commenting on the campaign idea, Sagar Kapoor, Executive Director, Lowe Lintas said, “The Resiquick tube is of superior design. It delivers one drop at a time hence is not clumsy to use. It also has a cap that can be reused, unlike most others in the category. So we decided to focus on the real benefit. Of course, delivered in an engaging and entertaining way. We were fortunate to get Varun Dhawan to help us do that. He lands the cheeky yet honest message of Resiquick. Sirf chipkao nahi, jodo!”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The films are&amp;nbsp;currently live on and offline. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#13;

      <news:title>Niine sanitary napkins’ campaign #SurakshaBandhan garners 4mn views</news:title>
      <news:description>Sanitary napkins brand, Niine, started the Niine Movement’s video campaign #SurakshaBandhan, which was supported by actors Akshay Kumar and Shabana Azmi has garnered over 4 million combined impressions and 2 million engagements in less than a week.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unveiled on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan, the video encouraged brothers to give their sisters the gift of hygiene and dignity concerning their menstrual health. Using the hashtag #SurakshaBandhan, the film has appealed to boys and men to think about giving their sisters a present that matters more than monetary or physical gratification with a Niine Sanitary Napkin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The challenger brand Niine Sanitary Napkins launched in India this year with a mission to provide wide access to a high quality, appropriately priced sanitary product to menstruating girls and women across rural and urban India, including in hard to reach areas and communities such as tribal people. The video campaign is the latest initiative by the Niine Movement, an ambitious five-year plan aimed at raising awareness on the importance of menstrual hygiene and tackling the taboos associated with menstruation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Amar Tulsiyan, Founder of the Niine Movement said, "With every view and every click of the campaign, Niine is making great progress in reaching out and educating more men about the sensitivities, and encouraging them to support menstrual hygiene. Through the campaign, we wish to enlighten every man in the country, and show each of them how important menstrual hygiene is for their loved ones. We need to bridge the gap and encourage both men and women to not just talk about menstrual hygiene but also encourage women to use sanitary napkins.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite menstruation being an experience lived by as many as 355 million girls and women in India, approximately only 18 per cent of them currently use sanitary napkins with approximately 82 per cent of women often reverting to unhygienic and unsafe alternatives such as old cloths, rags, hay and even ash. The reasons behind this staggering statistic include decades of archaic attitudes and stigma surrounding menstruation, the lack of choice and accessibility for safe and affordable sanitary products and the limited awareness of the importance of proper menstrual hygiene management; even amongst the 18 per cent, some are still unaware of maintaining proper genital hygiene and the correct usage of the product, often overusing sanitary napkins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Credits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creative Agency: Anomalous &lt;br&gt;Creative Director: Ankita Gupta&lt;br&gt;Director: Nitin Menon  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BaIoMVJxndM" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Pepperfry launches 'Why Wait for Diwali Sale' ahead of the festive season</news:title>
      <news:description>Pepperfry.com, India’s Furniture and Home Products marketplace has unveiled a new marketing campaign to launch the pre-festive “Why Wait For Diwali Sale”. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through this campaign, Pepperfry encourages customers to gear up for the festive season in advance by shopping the sale and availing discounts of up to 50 per cent off on just about everything on Pepperfry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Diwali is typically seen as the time to refresh, renew and rejuvenate. Consumers tend to put-off their high-value purchases, like furniture, until Diwali in order to cash in on festive promotional offers and discounts. Pepperfry aims to tap in to this, by giving customers compelling reasons to shop now. The key message of this campaign, revolves around driving interest to the “Why Wait for Diwali Sale” and encourages consumers to shop for furniture and home products, right now. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The new campaign revisits the brand’s core consumer promise of always providing unbeatable value, through great prices and amazing discounts. As the category leader, Pepperfry has been passing on the benefits derived by working directly with 10,000 home and furniture manufacturers to the consumers, thereby acting as an ally in their purchase cycle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a brand that has been ahead of the curve with its standout marketing strategy and communication, the new television commercial takes a highly stylistic, grand Broadway-esque approach to spice up the furniture and home ware category in India. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The campaign comprises one creative execution with 30 and 15 second edits that will be aired across key television channels like Colors, Star Movies, Sony, and Movies Now, as well as inmultiplexes across 5 cities, digital and social media. It has also been adapted for radio for top 5 markets. The total outlay for the month-long campaign is Rs. 12 crore and will reach 10 million Indian households. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The film conceptualised by Law and Kenneth Saatchi and Saatchi, has a spirited, exaggerated vibe that is hard to miss. Not to forget the unique dramatic appeal and hummable jingle which compel consumers to act now instead of procrastinating on big furniture purchases.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delna Sethna, Chief Creative Officer, L&amp;amp;K Saatchi &amp;amp; Saatchi said, “We were asked for a clutter breaking film high on energy that ensured people wouldn't wait until Diwali to buy new furniture... check, check and check.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talking about the latest campaign, Kashyap Vadapalli, Chief Marketing Officer, Pepperfry, said, “Pepperfry is known for single-handedly expanding the organised furniture category in India both online and offline. As consumers evolve beyond the hygiene factors like service and delivery we want to give them more reasons to shop by adding excitement to their furniture shopping experience with interesting designs, lots of variety and great value. Therefore, the tone and manner of our new commercial is vibrant with a theatrical approach which is very different from Pepperfry’s previous campaigns. With this campaign we want to trigger interesting conversations around the brand and the category.”  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j2SphaMixrM" rel="nofollow" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Ogilvy India working on creative mandate for Vodafone Idea Limited </news:title>
      <news:description>exchange4media has reliably learnt that Ogilvy India is the agency on record for Vodafone-Idea Limited (VIL). While VIL did not respond to exchange4media's request for a confirmation, Ogilvy India declined to comment on the matter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The merged entity that became operational on Friday is expected to come out with a fresh marketing campaign introducing the company to consumers in the next two weeks.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.vodafoneidea.com/" rel="nofollow"&gt;website &lt;/a&gt;of the new company is now live. The website sports two colours prominently: grey and orange. The colour palette seems to have been arrived at by mixing the colours of Vodafone and Idea Cellular: a rich red and bright yellow.    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1535780577_GmdpSv_voda-idea-sit_%281%29.jpg" style="width:450px;height:332px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The announcement of the merger noted that both Vodafone and Idea brands, which operate in different markets, will continue to function as separate brands under VIL. The marketing communication is expected to establish VIL as the parent company that nests Vodafone and Idea.</news:description>

While the proliferation of technology has given communications professionals a better grip on brand communication, it has also thrown at them a plethora of challenges, the biggest being the threat of brand dilution.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1535718232_8aWEv3_IPRCCA-logo_%281%29.jpg" style="width:350px;height:164px;float:right"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about this shift that the communications domain has witnessed over the years, Abhishek Mahapatra, Vice President and Head of Communications, Corporate Affairs at Nissan India said, “Communications domain has evolved in various ways over the years. If we break the communications space into three parts, it is essentially based on people, processes and product. The advent of technology has played a huge role in this evolution in corporate communications and&amp;nbsp;everything is now&amp;nbsp;24X7. Moreover, media relations used to be the&amp;nbsp;core of PR firms and corporate communications functions, and now it is one of the many things that we do.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Indian corporate communications history is not too old. In fact, the domain started getting noticed in a big way post the liberalisation era in 1991 when offshore companies set up offices in India and professional people handling it became the need of the hour. Almost three decades down the line, the industry is still grappling with some basic issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Mahapatra, despite this transformation, there are still big challenges that need to be tackled and one among them is talent crunch. “The corporate communications side has&amp;nbsp;always benefited from agency talent.&amp;nbsp;Most of the corporate communications heads today have an agency background. Earlier, even the quality of talent in the industry was - I won’t say better, I would say different. Dynamics are&amp;nbsp;now&amp;nbsp;different.&amp;nbsp;Earlier we used to do stakeholder engagement. Today we add another important layer of influencer engagement to it and that makes stakeholder engagement more holistic.&amp;nbsp;Moreover, the industry has grown manifold in the last 10 to 15 years and a lot of great talent has come to this industry. But is that talent trained? Well may be not. But I would blame ourselves for this because we have to ensure that we train them.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mahapatra also believes that the communications industry is moving towards a very strong zone where its practitioners have great experience in understanding what is earned media and they are thus able to push that understanding to the whole pay for play model. “Earlier we used to measure PR and Communications in EAV (Equivalent Ad Value), now all mature firms have moved away from that. Nobody assesses your success through the thickness of your docket anymore. So, measurement and laser sharp focus on analytics have come into communication, which was in its infancy few years back.&amp;nbsp;Communications is also benefitting from right use of Big Data and hence analytics is playing a key role to define impact, ROI and decision making&amp;nbsp;,” stated Mahapatra.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Speaking about how&amp;nbsp;content creation and new mediums have added to the transformation of communications function, Mahapatra said, "Earlier,&amp;nbsp;content was limited to print documentation (articles, releases) but now it has evolved to include visual storytelling and communications is playing a joint lead with marketing. For example at Nissan we have a 'content factory' set up inside communications function that's leading the content strategy and partnering with marketing. We are no more the distant seconds and are playing an equal or sometimes leading role in creating engaging content that's relevant, topical and contextual."</news:description>

      <news:title>Here's why so many brands are joining in for a glass of Horlicks</news:title>
      <news:description>Ever since UK pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline Plc requested bids for its $4.3 billion Indian consumer health unit, which owns the popular malted milk brand Horlicks, the battle among brands to acquire it is only heating up. While there have been speculations that Nestle, Unilever, Coca Cola and Mondelez are potential suitors in the race, the latest entrants are KKR, Kelloggs and UK healthcare giant Reckitt Benckiser Plc. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charting brand odyssey&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Who wouldn't want to acquire an iconic brand that has a history of over 140 years and has stood the test of time, only to prove how a legacy product can survive the odds. Brand Horlicks defied changing consumer preferences and withstood generations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the milk revolution, the rural development programme started by the National Dairy Development Board,&amp;nbsp; changed things in 1970s, Horlicks seized the opportunity to reinforce its role as a great nourisher for the family. The early ads were about providing daily nourishment to the family and the USP was energy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1536029710_Xp9PCF_horlicks-inside.jpg" style="width:443px;height:250px;vertical-align:middle"&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Their fictional character Suchitra struck a chord with audiences as she was mindful of her family’s health needs and would ensure they got their daily nourishment through Horlicks. Actor Amitabh Bachchan had lent his voice to the jingles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over time, the brand brought out variants for women and children of different age groups and contemporised the brand equity. One of their popular TV campaigns till date is the ‘Why do I drink Horlicks?’ commercial released in the 1980s. This has been one of the earliest instances of slice-of-life advertising as it showed people speaking about what they love about their glass of Horlicks. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then by 1990s, Horlicks made a decision. The brand began targeting specific consumer segments rather than the entire family. Extensions such as Junior Horlicks, Horlicks Lite (2005), Horlicks Nutribars (2006), Womens Horlicks and Mother's Horlicks soon surfaced. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While new variants kept coming in, the brand also kept discovering new ways to explain the same story--one about performance, achievement and addressing the mother and child nourishment. The brand has been consistent in its messaging, which has worked out in its favour. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong, stronger, strongest?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Horlicks proved that Indian marketers were not late in adapting the 5-second trick to drive their message. The brand, in its&amp;nbsp;consumer research, might have realised that products of&amp;nbsp;contemporaries or even Horlicks take time to mix with milk, which is a bother for consumers. Therefore, it came with a product innovation and positioning&amp;nbsp;that Horlicks mixes with milk in 5 seconds. Even before you can manage to skip the ad! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Also, the tussle between Horlicks and Complan is not unknown. Such was the intensity of the rivalry&amp;nbsp;that the brands were seen taking direct digs at each other in their print and television ads. One spot goes&amp;nbsp;with a Complan boy&amp;nbsp;saying, ‘My health drink has 23 nutrients, how much does yours have? To this, the Horlicks boy's answer is 23 nutrients. He then reinstates that Horlicks is better than Complan with even lesser price-points. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6U88R3LI_qM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t9WuI0hU5DY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When the brand released a clinical study, which claimed that children who consumed Horlicks were taller, stronger, and sharper, it became a starting point for one of the brand's campaign. Over time, the Horlicks ads spoke about stress reduction and children's hunger to grow as they continued dialing up the passion quotient in these spots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From being one of the pioneer brands leveraging the slice-of-life advertising approach to acing the comparative advertising and the five-second phenomenon, the brand, through its fairly good strategies, has fought through even the most turbulent times only to emerge stronger.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why more brands want to seal this deal?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brand expert Gaurav Gulati feels that strategically Horlicks is catering to all possible target markets and the brand and sub-brands have an advantage of filling the entire shelf space. &lt;br&gt;"GSK has beautifully positioned Horlicks in the Indian market. It won't be wrong to say that they have a strong first-mover advantage when it comes to women and protein consumers. It is very challenging for any competitor to get started with all the segments in one single go, especially in the market where clinical research and evidence play a major role," says Gulati.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Samsika's Jagdeep Kapoor asserts that as a brand, Horlicks has been able to enter the hearts and minds of consumers very strongly. "Whoever grabs it will be able to increase the distribution and will be able to sell it with their other brands. It will be an opportunity to strengthen their portfolio. While both Complan and Horlicks are up for sale, Horlicks makes for&amp;nbsp;a very powerful asset," he says. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;N. Chandramouli, CEO, TRA, says, "The legacy that the brand has built and the deep-rooted nostalgic feeling it triggers make it really powerful. It has been able to carve a brand equity for itself. The high-growth sector that the brand operates in is another factor. All in all, Horlicks is a very strong brand."</news:description>

      <news:title>It’s a viewer’s market &amp; it’s here to stay: Anil K Nair, L&amp;K Saatchi &amp; Saatchi</news:title>
      <news:description>Indians have always been an audio visual race. A land of storytelling and colour has now hooked on to Netflix and video based content fuelled by easy access to fat bandwidth and smart phones. This has gradually deconstructed the reading habit and the growth of print and magazines. Though the printed word is desperately trying to reinvent itself digitally through smaller pieces, blogs and the likes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1535938797_Q3EsOl_content-jam-logo.jpg" style="width:350px;height:193px;float:right"&gt;&lt;br&gt;Getting back to the topic of content in general and branded content in particular there are other conundrums. Earlier there was a clear demarcation of content and advertising. Advertising funded content and life was simple. And everyone was happy. One rewarded good content by backing it with more advertising dollars. Consumers knew that consuming advertising was the price to pay for the nearly subsidised content that they were devouring through their idiot boxes, newspapers and radio sets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But the smart phone and personal devices changed that dynamic for ever. Today content is going up against advertising as an option for marketers to plug brand narratives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now it is about personalised and granular on-demand content that can be consumed on the go as and when the viewer wants it. From storytelling to story making. And preferable co-created with the consumer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The viewers are done with ad interruptions given the fast diminishing millennial attention spans and the glut of content available at their fingertips.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s a viewer’s market and it’s here to stay. What it means for advertisers is that they need newer ways to favourably reach out to their audience without pissing them off, by fitting into their lives and convenience and in newer formats that the consumer adopts. Content aggregation and distribution are growing to be bigger influencers in the proliferation of content than ownership or destination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Formats have become like quicksand. From 3 hour movies to 30 second TVCs we are now in the world of diminishing ad utility. 15 seconders to 5 seconders are the new challenges for advertising story tellers notwithstanding the occasional IGTV kind of innovation. Newer video formats will keep emerging forcing brands and advertisers to constantly unlearn and adapt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The trickiest part of this drama is context. Content now has to ride along with context to win favour with viewers. The context can be cultural, organic, timely, multi-faceted and subliminal. Almost metaphorically like bitter medicine coated in a sweet pill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The consumers today are unforgiving and extremely fickle and are quick to sniff the advertising rat if it threatens to malign their content consumption mood and flow.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This has put traditional agencies in direct competition with pure play content creators who are better tuned and equipped to understand and satiate the content consumption monsters needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It’s also akin to the ‘nine blind men and the elephant story’ with the various players from the media agencies, creative agencies , digital platforms and the freshly sprung digital content studios all approaching this challenge from their own prism of expertise and perspective and trying to second guess the viewer and their likes and dislikes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This pressure to amuse and entertain is throwing up newer interesting content innovations like tent-pole live events that allow for direct brand- consumer interactions or that allow co- creation of content with audiences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The ones laughing all the way to their popcorn finally are the viewers who have the power to dismiss you with a flick of their fingers into hyper stardom or deep oblivion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The author is the Managing Partner, L&amp;amp;K Saatchi &amp;amp; Saatchi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: The views expressed here are solely those of the author and do not in any way represent the views of exchange4media.com.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out trends in the content-marketing space at the Audacity e4m Indian Content Marketing Awards 2018 (ICMA) and second edition of Content JAM, a Content Marketing Conference, set to take place on September 7. &lt;br&gt;For details, click here&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;a href="https://e4mevents.com/content-marketing-awards-icma-2018/" re="nofollow"&gt; https://e4mevents.com/content-marketing-awards-icma-2018/&lt;/a&gt;</news:description>

      <news:title>Influencers on social media are the new leaders of the free world: Parveez Nasyam- Xenium Digital </news:title>
      <news:description>This year Cannes was unique in many ways, and among the few takeaways, Keith Weed, Chief Marketing Officer of Unilever announced an urgent call to action to rebuild the trust with consumers before it is lost forever. He also declared that Unilever would not work with influencers who buy followers and urged the ad industry to do the same. This need to take a bolder step was important, as the fake- follower problem is seen as part of a much larger data fraud problem plaguing the advertising industry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In India there are a number of digital marketing agencies, who works with various brands to help them gain a bigger and better reach to the audience. Xenium, is also in the same league which lends the digital experience to the consumers using advanced technologies while bringing the brand to life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We spoke to Parveez Nasyam, CEO &amp;amp; Managing Director - Xenium Digital Pvt. Ltd. to know more about the current trends in the digital world and whether Adblocking software is a sign of worry for brands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edited Excerpts&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith Weed said, no more fake followers and bots. What's your take on this?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Influencers on social media are the new leaders of the free world. They govern over their humble followers by providing them with relevant content in exchange for their engagement. These leaders hold the power to make real changes, ignite a digital revolution. Influencers, who have come to power with the help of fake followers (bots), never have and never will be able to create an impact of any kind. Not long ago popular YouTuber and influencer Logan Paul was in a hot mess for showcasing a corpse in his video and making fun of it. He had to take down the video and temporarily delete his account before resurfacing after some time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the other hand, YouTubers such as Casey Neistat always have a positive influence on their subscribers and brands love to collaborate with him. Unilever has always been a Goliath in the world of advertising, online and offline, they are the torchbearers for ‘sustainability’ and to fulfill their long-term objective it is very important for them to have on board people who can soldier on their humble cause. Unilever wants ‘U’ to be the new symbol of sustainability and they are not subtle about it&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What companies should do, to invest in both incremental and transformation innovation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Transformational innovation in marketing is hard to come by these days and while our ‘Innovation Lab’ is constantly working on something new, we do not want to push those transformational innovations over to our clients unless it is the absolute need of the hour for their business. At the same time, incremental innovation is hardly working out these days. There are no, ‘new ideas’ in the market any more and most of advertising’s ‘out-of-the-box’ and mad ideas are done to death in some way or the other. We did not try to change the product; we brought a ‘break-through’ medium on the table for marketers to explore. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There is a popular saying, ‘try and try until you succeed’. There is also another popular saying, ‘Why tinker with a winning recipe.’ One cannot adopt any one of these and proceed to have a successful business. Some companies have come into existence due to their breakthrough innovations, the mobile industry being a popular example; some companies became successful due to incremental innovations, Apple phones being an example. None of these companies have stuck to any one strategy and have kept switching back and forth in order to sustain, depending on what the market demands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital marketing is a domain that needs lot of hands on and deeper delving to really get a hang of it. What strategies work for you to connect the brands with customer easily?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are three ways: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;i. Connect on an emotional level with your clients–People reciprocate most to emotions. Many brands have been successfully utilizing this approach. Apple, Johnson and Johnson’s, Maruti have been making this work for many years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ii. Know yourself – When you know yourself, you will be clear about what you are capable of. This is why you won’t over commit, or have unrealistic expectations and will be ultimately extremely confident about the outcome of any project that you take on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;iii. Know your competition, client and consumer – Awareness is extremely important when you approach a task. It goes without saying that analysing and staying updated about your client, competition and consumer will make or break your brand.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Last year we saw programmatic trading as a foremost digital trend, which trend do you see this year?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two things, the first being, ‘Going live’ and second being, ‘making augmented reality’s appeal more widespread.’ Instagram, Facebook and YouTube, have gone guns blazing with the ‘live’ feature and the world has been going gaga about it. Live news updates, live events, live everything; there was no delay in between capturing the experience and sharing it. It has caught up with professional agencies as well and very soon we might have live marketing campaigns, live movies, and live ads! The potential is endless. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Augmented reality became mainstream and a household name with, ‘Pokemon Go’, it took the world by storm, people loved it, and it is going to make a comeback along with many other applications as well. Augmented reality will be incorporated in social media, games, film and other applications. This is the future and there is no escaping it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think the use of AdBlocking software’s is a sign of worry for brands?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;AdBlocking software has existed for decades and with the growing need for privacy it has evolved and become more sophisticated. Apple had adopted ad blocking in its IOS9 for all its Apple mobile handsets followed by implementing it in its Safari browsers. Google saw the light in Apple’s decision to do so and did the same. It is important for brands to understand that there is so much noise in the world of advertising that creating something appealing and path-breaking is difficult. That along with the constant intrusion of ads is unwelcoming, to say the least. Considering alternate approaches such as paid partnerships, product placements, creating experiences and not being ‘salesy’ are very essential in the world we live in. So Adblocking software is simply irrational fears among people creating irrelevant content for an irresponsible market.</news:description>
