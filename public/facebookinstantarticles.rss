      <article><p><p>Titan Company Ltd, which has successfully launched many lifestyle brands over the years-- Titan, Tanishq, Fastrack, Xylys, Raga, Skinn (fragrances), has now entered the textile category with its new offering Taneira.</p>

<p>The company might be a late entrant in the category, but it plans to draw on its strong brand appeal to build its presence across the country.</p>

<p>At the launch of Taneira&rsquo;s first flagship store, Bhaskar Bhat, Managing Director, Titan Company Limited, spoke about Titan&rsquo;s new offering and the changing retail landscape in the country.</p>

<p>Excerpts:</p>

<p><strong>What was the thought behind launching this new category?</strong></p>

<p>See where I sit,&nbsp;which is as the head of the company,&nbsp;it has to be a combination of&nbsp;inspiration and business sense.&nbsp;We have what is known as a sandbox,&nbsp;it&#39;s called the Titan hexagon,&nbsp;which we apply to look at the future.&nbsp;One of the important sides of this hexagon is the under-served and underpenetrated&nbsp;and under-organized.&nbsp;Any category which has two out of three of these,&nbsp;we would like to explore.</p>

<p>So in that process, we found this (Taneira) as one, and we have several others.&nbsp;And as we explored more and more, we realized&nbsp;that it has&nbsp;a significant proportion of unorganized. We also realized that this is a category where we can bring more value,&nbsp;and it is a very big category.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking at the size of this category and given our ability to transform the category combined with our strong retail play is a big strength that we have. Also, branding in this category has not happened so often in the past, and branding is something we bring to the table&nbsp;apart from retail expertise.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>In a world which is betting big on digital and considers mobile as the future, how would you contextualize this big investment in offline retail?</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t think offline will ever go away for categories where&nbsp;standardization is not the driver of the demand.&nbsp;Anything which has touched and feel has a very strong offline component.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;the marriage of the two is what we do,&nbsp;which is called Omni, and we are doing that very well, for example in the eyewear category.</p>

<p><strong>Would you call yourself a late entrant in this category? How do you plan to take on players who have been in this business for a long time?</strong></p>

<p>Our impulse is never to compete, our impulse is to serve. I&#39;m not saying this in any philosophical manner. We have found great value and inspiration in being&nbsp;totally driven by the consumers.&nbsp;So consumer insight is a very important function&nbsp;in the company.</p>

<p>In every store, we listen to our customers and&nbsp;we are driven by the customers. That is what has brought us size and scale,&nbsp;and what happens to the competitors&nbsp;in a way is not our problem. Our purpose is not to kill the competition; our purpose is to bring value. I believe we will create so much value&nbsp;that people would want to come to us.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>You have </strong><strong>helmed</strong><strong> the success of Titan across categories, what would you call the enablers of this success story?</strong></p>

<p>Fundamentally, customer-centricity; we are driven by the customers;&nbsp;fantastic people orientation in the company. We have a theory about people-- which is unconditional positive regard.&nbsp;It means people first before any other stakeholder. So we are totally people focused. The other factor is design.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How do you see the future of retail panning out in India over the next few years?</strong></p>

<p>I think it will be Omni&nbsp;and the relevance of&nbsp;brick and mortar stores will continue.&nbsp;As I said,&nbsp;for standard products and technology led products,&nbsp;it will&nbsp;become less and less relevant&nbsp;but there will be flagship stores,&nbsp;which will be less for sales and more for showcasing.</p></p><header><h1>Our purpose is to bring value, not kill competition: Bhaskar Bhat, MD, Titan</h1>

      <article><p><p>Lately, the woman behind the famed Mumbai Police department&rsquo;s Twitter handle (@MumbaiPolice) finds herself catching up on the latest binge-worthy shows, viral memes and Twitter trends whenever she finds the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From Game of Thrones and Stranger Things to Twitter memes like GharSeNikalTeHi, Sunchika Pandey and her team is thinking content round the clock and tries to never miss a social media opportunity for the Mumbai Police. Over the last three years, the Mumbai Police Department&rsquo;s Twitter handle has become every Mumbaikar&rsquo;s go-to channel for latest updates on law and order related happenings in the city, to register complaints, all while being treated to social media memes on the side. The social media strategy is a prime example for consumer facing brands that are trying to establish a strong social media presence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Seeing Content Everywhere</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Content has become a state of mind for the Mumbai Police social media team. &quot;If I see a glass lying around on the table, I wonder how to use it as content!&quot; she says. But she is not cued into all the millenial themes and trends, so she&nbsp;generally gets all her&nbsp;references checked with her&nbsp;team of youngsters.&nbsp;&quot;But now I am also watching all the popular shows,&rdquo; confesses Pandey, who is&nbsp;the Group Director of its Citizen Initiatives &amp; Government division at independent digital agency, Gozoop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not just Pandey, even the policemen who run the Twitter operations for the department have begun looking at the world around them through the lens of &ldquo;content.&rdquo; This is the result of the Mumbai Police department&rsquo;s innovative attempt at reaching out to the citizens of Mumbai through the micro-blogging platform three years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every brand is talking the language of content, and there is no reason&nbsp;the Mumbai Police should be found lagging. &ldquo;What ticks with the readers now-a-days is content. Content that is quirky, trendy, timeless, resonating...&nbsp;the list goes on. Mumbai Police has ticked all the boxes.&nbsp;Messages about safety, social &amp; traffic discipline, celebration, respect for martyrs, cyber security, and all such occasions are so very well weaved into different engaging formats of content. By default you end up consuming these pieces and the point is driven home,&rdquo; says Shekhar Mhaskar, EVP Isobar India, decoding the success of the Mumbai Police&#39;s social media game.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The first tweet we ever put out was : Why should the police station be the only place where we meet? Let&rsquo;s meet here every day,&rdquo; recollects Pandey. Hers and her&nbsp;team&rsquo;s efforts to make the police department more approachable and less fearful for&nbsp;the citizens has earned the department the moniker Meme-bai Police and Amul of Government departments.</p>

<p><strong>Response Engenders Trust&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hidden under the satirical content and prompt informative responses from the department is a lesson for all marketers who are trying to create a social media persona for their brands. To Pandey the lesson is very simple: a clear vision plus knowledge of target audience complemented by fulfilment of brand promise = success.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even Pandey knows this is easier said than done. Social media handles of most consumer facing companies are inundated with complaints from disgruntled consumers every day. These complaints are mostly met with automated responses that only irk consumers further.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are instances when a disgruntled consumer feels a loss of trust with the brand because of a negative experience and cannot be assuaged by following documented response matrices. This is where a brand can elevate itself to the next level of sophistication &ndash; with their ability to humanise interactions and setting up of strong internal processes that speak with different departments to effectively act upon their customer commitments,&rdquo; says Sakshi Arora, Strategy Director, Digitas India.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anticipating the citizen outpouring, at least eight policemen and two senior police officers monitor the Mumbai Police and Police Commissioner&rsquo;s Twitter handles at any given point. The policemen monitor the tweets and direct messages sent to these two handles until 3-4am every day. &ldquo;The clear mandate when we started out was that we must respond to every single tweet,&rdquo; Pandey says.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kidding, but seriously...</strong></p>

<p>The mission of the Mumbai Police was to utilise Twitter as yet another touchpoint where the department could interact with the citizens. &ldquo;It was not in our plan to make it iconic in the way that it has become,&rdquo; says Pandey with humility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We wanted to make people smile and that&rsquo;s how we thought about using humour in our posts.&rdquo; At the same time as the Twitter handle of the police department the content had to always adhere to a certain high moral and ethical code. &ldquo;As Mumbai Police we needed to maintain the dignity of the officers and the uniform. That is why we chose satire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mumbai Police has resonated with the citizens of Mumbai by &ldquo;challenging the status quo on the type of online personality an administrative body should have,&rdquo; says Arora. This dark humour coupled with healthy engagement with citizens gives Mumbai Police its clutter breaking social presence and huge organic following.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Brands typically monitor their social media handles but worry that saying something edgy will get them trolled. Typically BFSI, healthcare, and B2B brands are uncomfortable about using humour on social channels. But the Mumbai Police is okay with taking a stance and even responding to citizens. Now the mental impression of Mumbai Police has improved because of the social media presence of the department,&rdquo; says Siddharth Hegde, MD &amp; Founder, Ethinos Digital Marketing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All of these factors have made Mumbai Police a social media case study that other police departments across the country have begun to emulate. The Bangalore and Kolkata City Police engage with their citizens on social media very successfully. &quot;Even the UP Police has launched a Twitter account and that has helped the department improve its image,&quot; quips Pandey. As the&nbsp;&nbsp;Group Director of its Citizen Initiatives &amp; Government division at Gozoop, Pandey wishes to work with more government bodies, helping them engage in a healthy manner with citizens.&nbsp;</p></p><header><h1>Learning a thing or two from the Mumbai Police about upping the Social Media game</h1>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:8.0pt; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The question that now arises is will the brand be impacted due to this? What&rsquo;s interesting is that Zomato&rsquo;s competitor Swiggy recently rolled an ad communication asking consumers to empathise with delivery partners, as they, like each one of us, have a name and unique identity that they would like everybody to acknowledge. Will this incident then jeopardize Zomato&rsquo;s image and give its competitors an edge over it? Or will Zomato be able to reclaim itself just right post the fiasco?</span></span></p>

Moreover, people might start poking the brand and Zomato delivery boys with sarcasm and prefer to use the services of their competitors instead. But it is high time for all these brands to take food tampering and hygiene very seriously.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

After all, it&rsquo;s the matter of existence now.</span></span></p>

It is important to make food handling and delivery totally tamper-proof. Packaging can play a crucial role here,&rdquo; says Bijoor.</span></span></p>

      <article><p><p style="margin-bottom:8.0pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="background:white"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="color:#222222">2018 has been a rather action-packed year for ZEE5 and the upcoming year or two will only see things getting bigger and better for ZEEL&rsquo;s OTT platform with more investments being pushed in that direction. Punit Goenka, MD &amp; CEO of ZEEL, had mentioned earlier in one of his interviews that the streaming service is their next big bet when it comes to investment and cornering incremental and additional viewers. With increasing investment he is expecting the business to break even in three to five years.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8.0pt; text-align:start; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="background:white"><span style="font-variant-ligatures:normal"><span style="font-variant-caps:normal"><span style="orphans:2"><span style="widows:2"><span style="text-decoration-style:initial"><span style="text-decoration-color:initial"><span style="word-spacing:0px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="color:#222222">Tarun Katial, CEO, ZEE5, talks to e4m about the future plans and how the past year has been for the OTT platform, including the reception, region specific subscription pack and original content. Excerpts:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:start; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="background:white"><span style="font-variant-ligatures:normal"><span style="font-variant-caps:normal"><span style="orphans:2"><span style="widows:2"><span style="text-decoration-style:initial"><span style="text-decoration-color:initial"><span style="word-spacing:0px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="color:#222222">Innovative pricing</span></span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="color:#222222">Apart from bringing in regional content, ZEE5 played around with the pricing and introduced special subscription packs for Tamil, Telugu and Kannada audience. This enables users to access premium language content at half the price (Rs 49/month).<br />
Katial shared that the reception to these region specific packs has been &lsquo;great&rsquo; as they are offering live TV, regional original content, digital movie premieres and early access to regional shows even before TV. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s a healthy bouquet of content with lot of depth for Tamil, Telugu and Kannada consumers. After South, we will take a break for a quarter and go East,&rdquo; revealed Katial. &nbsp;<br />
2018 saw original regional content really taking off with OTT players eyeing growth from tier II and III cities. But that, says Katial, was just the tip of the iceberg. &ldquo;2019 will be the actual year of language (regional) content, the big proliferation of original content and digital movies in India. The uptake of original content will move 3-4 times,&rdquo; he said.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt; text-align:start; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="background:white"><span style="font-variant-ligatures:normal"><span style="font-variant-caps:normal"><span style="orphans:2"><span style="widows:2"><span style="text-decoration-style:initial"><span style="text-decoration-color:initial"><span style="word-spacing:0px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="color:#222222">Katial also mentioned the launch of a premium brand around ZEE5. &quot;It&rsquo;s in the process of being created. SVOD section will be branded separately. It&rsquo;s a different experience than AVOD subset. Several features will be added to it.&quot;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:start; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="background:white"><span style="font-variant-ligatures:normal"><span style="font-variant-caps:normal"><span style="orphans:2"><span style="widows:2"><span style="text-decoration-style:initial"><span style="text-decoration-color:initial"><span style="word-spacing:0px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="color:#222222">Content game strong</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="background:white"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="color:#222222">Right from its launch, ZEE5 has kept its content game strong especially for originals and movie acquisition. It came out with 15 originals across six languages including the big-budget &lsquo;Karenjit Kaur&rsquo; and big digital premieres of popular titles such as Mulk, Parmanu, Stree and Veere Di Wedding. The strategy of movie premieres particularly worked as it was one of the major consumption drivers. &nbsp;<br />
It&rsquo;s now looking to launch over 90 originals in FY2019 and reach 150+ digital premiers in the next 18 months. Katial mentioned that audience sees value in original content as it&rsquo;s a big differentiator. This explains the deep investment. &ldquo;Original movies did well, case in point being &lsquo;Tiger&rsquo; (Emraan Hashmi) We have &lsquo;Rangbaaz&rsquo; coming up next month with Saqib Saleem which is as big as &lsquo;Karenjit Kaur&rsquo; for us. Then there will be big original shows in Tamil, Telugu, Bengali and Marathi. We will amp up in 2019. A slate of 40-50 big shows will come up over the next two quarters,&rdquo; Katial added.<br />
AVOD is not getting overshadowed as Katial sees TV shows and their characters being big drivers. &ldquo;We have content beyond the general shows like character journeys and best scenes. Lot of content is created outside the core content. We will continue to invest behind that as well.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="background:white"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="color:#222222">&quot;Language original content, shows around specific themes and relevant topics will continue to resonate well with Indian consumers. You will see off-take in subscription,&quot; says Katial.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:start; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="background:white"><span style="font-variant-ligatures:normal"><span style="font-variant-caps:normal"><span style="orphans:2"><span style="widows:2"><span style="text-decoration-style:initial"><span style="text-decoration-color:initial"><span style="word-spacing:0px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><strong><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="color:#222222">Distribution</span></span></span></strong><br />
<span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="color:#222222">Like any other OTT streaming platform, ZEE5 hasn&rsquo;t left any stone unturned to reach the consumer.&nbsp; This goes beyond the regular tie-ups with telecom service providers, digital wallets and smart TVs. For instance, for travel start-up RailYatri customers, ZEE5 had introduced a sachet subscription which gets bundled with the bookings. Similar partnerships with Oyo, MakeMyTrip and RedBus among others are aimed at travel-loving consumers by offering them discounts. &ldquo;Sachet consumers come for a short period of time and want entertainment on the go.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:start; -webkit-text-stroke-width:0px; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="background:white"><span style="font-variant-ligatures:normal"><span style="font-variant-caps:normal"><span style="orphans:2"><span style="widows:2"><span style="text-decoration-style:initial"><span style="text-decoration-color:initial"><span style="word-spacing:0px"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="font-size:11.0pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;"><span style="color:#222222">All this and more is definitely working as the ZEE5 app garnered 41.3 million Monthly Active Users in Sep&rsquo;18, a whopping 190% growth since Apr&rsquo;18, according to data provided by ZEE5. And they have just about begun.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

      <article><p><p>Water heater brand Hindware Atlantic, part of the sanitaryware company HSIL, recently released its first TVC campaign for the Ondeo Series &lsquo;Fresh Hot Water Saalon Saal&rsquo;. The TVC highlights the industry-first and Patented O&#39;Pro Protection Technology and Titanium Core Shield of the Ondeo range which prevents internal corrosion, thereby enhancing the life of water heaters. In 2015, HSIL had entered the home appliances segment with a collaboration with Groupe Atlantic of France.</p>

<p>Commenting on the insight&nbsp;behind the TVC for its water heater brand Hindware Atlantic, Rakesh Kaul, President and Chief Executive, Consumer Products Division &amp; CEO EVOK Retail, HSIL Limited says, &ldquo;We wanted to bring a campaign to help consumers understand what is happening inside their water heaters as they are not aware of the corrosion and dirt deposits that are formed inside the tank over the years. Thus the first ad campaign focuses on our water heaters equipped with the Patented O&#39;Pro Protection Technology and its Titanium Core Shield helps protect the tank longer from corrosion. The &lsquo;Fresh Hot Water&nbsp;Saalon&nbsp;Sal&rsquo; campaign emphasizes the prolonged life of Hindware Atlantic water heaters as compared to any other ordinary water heaters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Conceptualized and created by DDB Mudra, the film captures how corrosion and dirty deposits impact the longevity of a water-heater in a light-hearted neo-mythological format. Speaking on the brief given to the creative agency, Kaul says, &ldquo;Our brief to the agency was to voice the aforementioned insight in a humorous and light-hearted manner. Hindware Atlantic Ondeo series comes with patented technology which prolongs the life of the product,&nbsp;our&nbsp;ask from the agency was to keep this messaging at the heart of the commercial while creating an ad that is not just engaging but also entertaining.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hindware has taken a multi-pronged marketing approach for the commercial through various platforms such as Electronic and Digital. For a wider reach, the TVC is being aired on key regional channels in languages like Bengali, Kannada, Tamil, and Telugu including prominent Movies and News channels. Kaul says, &ldquo;We&#39;ve kept a sizable budget for the TV&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;so that it&#39;s well tailored to reach out to our target audience.&rdquo; Talking about ad-spends he says, &ldquo;We will spend up to Rs 50 crores this financial year on marketing to build our brands across categories. The majority of the spends will be on digital marketing and advertising during festival season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking about the company&rsquo;s growth Kaul says, &ldquo;We have grown phenomenally in all the categories we are present in over the years. In the chimney segment, we are already among the Top 3 players with a 15-16% market share. Our water heaters category is doing extremely well and in a span of 24 months, we have grown 165% more than last year and currently have 6-6.5% market share in this category.&rdquo; Looking ahead he adds, &ldquo;We aim to be amongst the top 3 brands in the category of water heaters by end 2020 and similarly be amongst the top 3 in the water purifiers category in next 5 years and are working to extend our distribution and retailer network, after sales network and introduce tech led variants in the categories to ensure we achieve our target.&rdquo;</p>

      <article><p><p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">WPP&rsquo;s radical evolution plan laid down at the Investor Day on Tuesday indicates that following the hiring freeze, the network will be cutting jobs globally. It was revealed that WPP&rsquo;s restructuring will include shutting 80 offices globally and combining operations of a further 100 in locations where business is slow.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">&ldquo;Fewer businesses make it easier to manage, but unfortunately there will be job losses from bringing businesses together,&rdquo; said Mark Read, CEO, WPP, during his presentation. The company is said to cut 3,500 of its 1,34,000 global workforce. WPP has 400 ad businesses in more than 3,000 offices in 112 countries.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Responding to a question from an analyst about further consolidation in the WPP group of companies, Read clarified that WPP will not be looking at more mergers for now. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Over the last three months, WPP has reviewed and restructured agencies that make up for 23 per cent of its revenue. Read called the mergers of VML with Y&amp;R and Wunderman with JWT &ldquo;tough choices&rdquo; and added that the merged companies should be able to provide more integrated solutions to clients. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">&ldquo;There is nothing worse than running a company in a so-called traditional area that is doomed forever to the client,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">In this new radical phase of WPP, Read said, he is banning the use of the word &ldquo;digital&rdquo; and veering more towards technology. WPP is positioning itself as a &ldquo;creative transformation company&rdquo; that uses &ldquo;creativity as differentiator and technology as growth engine,&rdquo; Read said. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">&ldquo;Any company that is not deeply investing in technology will not be successful in the next 5 or 10 or 25 years. I think it is incumbent on us to do that in the right way,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Talking about the mergers that WPP has undertaken recently, Read said the artificial difference between analog and digital is not helpful in understanding the world. &ldquo;Removing those distinctions helps you get to the answer better,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Making a reference to ex-CEO Sir Martin Sorrell&rsquo;s reference to Google and Facebook as frenemies, Read said those companies should be treated as &ldquo;technology partners not as frenemies; as partners and also increasingly and interestingly as clients.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">He further said that WPP&rsquo;s technology strategy is to become a developer of technology and not just an integrator. &ldquo;We cannot compete with Google or Adobe in terms of technology, but we can leverage the spend of many large partners and stitch their systems together to give us what we need.&quot;</span></span></p>

      <article><p><p>Technology is enabling a new marketing dynamic which is making the task for marketers more insightful and efficient while also retaining its own set of complexities.</p>

<p>Sharing the impact and correlation between new marketing technology and brand communication, Kaushal Kurapati, Group Vice President Product Management at Oracle strongly believes that marketing technology has heralded a new era for the domain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Over the years print has given way to TV and TV now holds a big sway of advertising dollars. &nbsp;Also, the advent of performance marketing, internet and smartphones has unleashed new form factors and new ways of targeting consumers. All of this is primarily because technology is driving consumer behaviour to change. Now marketers have to understand this difference in consumer behaviour and be able to target appropriately. &nbsp;Otherwise they will be missing a big opportunity,&rdquo; said Kurapati.</p>

<p>Underling the difference between big data vs. quality data and the need to give precedence to the latter, Kurapati&nbsp;believes that this issue is not unique to the Indian market but a global phenomenon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that struggle is world over and not just in India. If the data going in is noisy then your prediction and your estimation and all of those factors will be bad as well. Smart businesses or smart organisations have to take care while considering data and I think a lot of people miss that point. So, it is not just about the amount of data but also the quality of data that is important.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When asked to define the most popular technology solutions that brands are seeking from technology providers, Kurapati&nbsp;explained, &ldquo;Many brands would like to monitor what is going on in the social media space and how people are talking about the brand in terms of the positive or negative sentiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Also when it comes to mobile apps, they want to understand what happens to the customer journey as they come and navigate the site and also to understand the overall digital foot print,&rdquo; he further added.</p>

<p>With growing concerns about data privacy and the implementation of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in mature data markets, regulatory concerns may pose challenge to big data usage in the coming time.</p>

<p>When asked to explain the role of technology providers in such a scenario, Kurapati&nbsp;said, &ldquo;GDPR is having a big impact not just in the European context but also technology solutions are getting compliant that way. Big countries like India want data jurisdiction within their borders, it is happening in the payment space, it will happen in the consumer behaviour space too. It is the question of when not if in my view, and it will require some change on part of the technology providers too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sharing his thoughts about the future of marketing technology, Kurapati&nbsp;added, &ldquo;We will see a unified data picture because there is still data in silos even in the advanced data markets. &nbsp;Figuring out what to recommend as a product based on what you already purchased would become more strategic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Explaining the critical role that India is poised to play as the centre of big data, Kurapati&nbsp;said, &ldquo;India over the years has become one of the lowest data rate markets in the world. &nbsp;This has led to a change in the consumer behaviour and an explosion in terms of spending time on the mobile phone. This consumer behaviour change has made India a data rich market, and because of that data richness I think it is quickly becoming an ideal market to experiment and try out different things.&rdquo;<br />

Issues such as trolls, data safety and digital addiction are being spoken about more vocally than before and social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are taking due cognizance to address these concerns.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:10.0pt; margin-left:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">At a recent event in New Delhi, Ankhi Das, Public Policy Director, Facebook -India, South &amp; Central Asia; and Mahima Kaul, Head, Public Policy &amp; Government Partnerships, Twitter India; spoke about the issue of &lsquo;digital revolution and social challenges&rsquo;.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:10.0pt; margin-left:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Answering a question on the increasing addiction to social platforms like Facebook and the way to deal with it, Ankhi Das said, &ldquo;We are creating a &lsquo;time spent&rsquo; dashboard and it will&nbsp;help to self-regulate.&nbsp; Also I think it is the responsibility of all of us as a society&nbsp;to address it. We have created a network of safety partners and mental health&nbsp;experts,&nbsp;including institutions like Tata Institute of Social Sciences, to tackle it.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:10.0pt; margin-left:0cm; text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Das also spoke about Facebook&rsquo;s thrust on promoting regional languages and reaching out to people beyond the big cities.</span></span></p>

A lot of consumption is happening in the local languages.

      <article><p><p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Orienta Cine Advertising Pvt. Ltd has launched one of India&rsquo;s biggest digital signages at Ambience Mall, Vasant Kunj, Delhi. The signage is made up of 63 OLED panels from LG.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Ketan Lakhani, Director, Orienta Cine Advertising, said, &ldquo;HS Ad is our partner for this signage. It is the most advanced digital signage with all modern features such as augmented reality, 360-degree visibility, Wi-Fi, sound and camera below the units that will help us capture eyeballs.&rdquo; </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Talking about &#39;indoor vs outdoor&#39; screens, Lakhani said, &ldquo;We cannot compare outdoor screens with indoor ones. But I feel digital always looks better in a closed environment and indoor gives better visibility to the advertisers.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Digital signage has come up as an innovative technology in the OOH market. It is gaining popularity as it engages with the audience in a much more effective manner than static signages.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Until some years ago, digital OOH was plagued by several challenges, including lack of technology advancement, lack of government permission&nbsp;to install screens in public places and slow growth of infrastructure, but the scenario has changed now.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Though the cost of LED and OLED is high, their demand is growing at a very fast pace of around 30 per cent. The number of DOOH screens has grown five-fold to 60,000 over the past three years. Industry estimates suggest that the DOOH market could grow 20-25 per cent over the next five years, or more than double the rate of the total OOH market.</span></span></p></p><header><h1>Orienta Cine Advertising launches digital signage with 63 OLED panels</h1>

      <article><p><p>Ajay Gahlaut, who recently quit as Chief Creative Officer of Ogilvy North and Deputy Chief Creative Officer of Ogilvy India, is believed to be joining Publicis.</p>

<p>Galaut is expected to succeed Bobby Pawar, who quit Publicis to join Havas Media. Pawar was the Managing Director and Chief Creative Officer, Publicis Worldwide South Asia.</p>

<p>The development has been confirmed to exchange4media by highly-placed sources. We reached out to Gahlaut for a confirmation, but are yet to get a response.</p>

<p>At Ogilvy, Gahlaut&nbsp;worked on brands such as Pernod Ricard, BMW, KFC, Taco Bell, Dabur, Perfetti Van Melle, Mother Dairy, Pizza Hut, Sprite, Best Foods, HT Mint and Philips.</p>

<p>Gahlaut worked with Ogilvy as a creative consultant between 2001 and 2005, after which he left. He re-joined the agency in 2007 and had been with it ever since. He has previously worked with agencies such as McCann, Saatchi &amp; Saatchi (then Sista Saatchi &amp; Saatchi), among others.</p></p><header><h1>Ajay Gahlaut to join Publicis</h1>

      <article><p><p>The last two weeks have witnessed a number of Chief Creative Officer (CCO) movements. Ajay Gahlaut recently quit as chief creative officer of Ogilvy North and deputy chief creative officer, Ogilvy India. Gahlaut is expected to&nbsp;join Publicis, replacing Bobby Pawar who is slated&nbsp;&nbsp;to join Havas Media in January.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ashish Chakravarty quit Contract India to join McCann India as creative head while Sagar Mahabalaleshwarkar has taken on Chakravarty&rsquo;s place at Contract.</p>

<p>The question here is,&nbsp;what has changed all of a sudden&nbsp;to lead to such a large-scale churn? As per the owner of a manpower search agency specializing in ad and media hiring, &ldquo;It is a result of ad firms trying to reinvent themselves to keep pace with the rise of digital, which have upended the marketing business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With digital coming in, creativity has become&nbsp;far more complicated than it used to be. Agencies, regardless of their respective sizes, need to keep reviewing how they are coping (or not) with the digital wave.&nbsp;Hence, overhauling existing creative teams is one of the priorities, points out a former CCO turned independent ad-man. &ldquo;Digital has, of course, changed a lot. Agencies are now creating hundreds, if not thousands pieces of creative, a month. This rise of social media and platforms in general has meant that creativity is more targeted than ever. So most large agencies are constantly re-evaluating the positions and talent pool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Sandeep Goyal, former President of Rediffusion and ex Chairman of Dentsu India remarks that there is paucity of talent at that level. &quot;Most creative directors of certain seniority and stature set up creative shops of their own in recent years leaving fewer and fewer talent available for employment by agencies. &quot; Goyal opines that the bigger problem is that these creative satraps also invariably carry some creative followers into their new agencies. So a lot of attrition and turmoil all around. &quot;Network pressure today is simply how many global awards you pocket, how much new biz you win. Earlier it was not easy to quantity and compare. Now it is. Laggards are always under pressure. Quitting &lsquo;for better prospects&rsquo; is the easy way out,&quot; he explains.</p>

<p>The job-list of a CCO entails&nbsp;supervising the creative team, directing their output, developing design concepts that further the company&rsquo;s identity to anticipating the future direction of the industry using research and insight and bringing the company in fore of that trajectory.</p>

<p>Industry sources share that one of the biggest shifts has been the network-pressures, which can also be attributed to the high churn rate. &ldquo;Agencies today are angling to ingrain themselves deeper within client&rsquo;s businesses, to centralize themselves closer to the bottom line. The revenue streams are being attacked on various fronts which does lead to cost-cutting. One being given the polite exit signal under a cost-cutting mission is the &lsquo;new&rsquo; normal in the business,&rdquo; shared an ad-agency co-founder on condition of anonymity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another source argues that in case anything goes wrong, a CCO is one of the most visible heads. Besides, a CCO who merely handles ad campaigns and branding consistency is a missed opportunity. &ldquo;CCOs today end up being easier scapegoats if the business isn&#39;t doing too well. Infact, this person needs a seat at the table when executive business plans are being created and the leverage to present big interruptions and lead the team through strategic brainstorming too. This remains one reason they&#39;re likely to want to quit or switch their work culture,&quot; said the source.</p></p><header><h1>Why the sudden rise in CCOs quitting and switching jobs?</h1>

      <article><p><p>Amidst speculations of BARC (Broadcast Audience Research Council) not releasing ratings for two months in the backdrop of TRAI rating order, industry sources told exchange4media a concrete decision on this is expected in a meeting of stakeholders later this month.</p>

<p>Senior industry sources also confirmed that there were &quot;premature&quot; discussions around it during meetings held few weeks ago. However, nothing concrete has been decided as of now. &quot;It was discussed as one of the possible options to deal with the scenario as most of us are trying to find ways to tackle the issue,&quot; said a senior industry source.</p>

<p>Industry veterans however emphasized on the need for creating public awareness on the TRAI order for its better implication.</p>

<p>A senior executive said, &ldquo;The meeting was scheduled to take place tomorrow. However the meeting has been rescheduled because many board members were not available. Only in that meeting we will come to know whether it&#39;s going to happen or not. Also there is no mention of this in any agenda. As of now this is only word of mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another senior industry expert said, &ldquo;The suggestion has some logic because when there will be disruption of this magnitude nobody should be in a position to take advantage showing ratings in this phase.&rdquo; Going by the information the meeting will happen in next 15 days.</p>

<p>This kind of a blackout has happened twice - in 2012 when the government had asked for the mandatory switch from analogue to digital cable and second time in 2015 when the industry moved from TAM to BARC.</p>

<p>As per our sources, there is a lot of uncertainty on the implementation of the Tariff order post January 1, 2018, due to the pending petitions in court and DTH/cable operators expecting to get a stay order; there is a higher probability that the implantation date of this order will be pushed ahead further.</p>

<p><strong>The order</strong></p>

<p>Early this year, Star had approached the Apex court questioning TRAI&rsquo;s jurisdiction to frame tariff order on the grounds that the authority has no jurisdiction on content as that actually comes under Copyright Act and not TRAI Act.</p>

<p>The appeal was filed against the fractured judgement passed by a two-judge Bench of Madras High Court comprising Chief Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice M Sundar. The bench had given a split verdict. Justice M Sundar had ruled in favour of Star. Commenting on the judgement delivered by Justice M Sundar, the Supreme Court order stated, &ldquo;I am unable to agree with the conclusion of M. Sundar, J. that the provisions of the impugned Regulation and the impugned Tariff Order are not in conformity with the TRAI Act. In my view the impugned provisions neither touch upon the content of programmes of broadcasters, nor liable to be struck down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;However, the clause putting cap of 15% to the discount on the MRP of a bouquet is arbitrary. The said provision is, in my view, not enforceable. In my considered view, the challenge to the impugned Regulation and the impugned Tariff Order fail,&rdquo; the order read further.</p>

<p>The 2017 Regulations prevented the mixing of pay channels and free to air channels in a single bouquet. &nbsp;The Regulations restricted placing high definition format and ordinary format of the same channel in the same bouquet. &nbsp;Another restriction was that a bouquet of pay channels should not contain any pay channel where the Maximum Retail Price is more than Rs 19.<br />

      <article><p><p>The results of assembly election in Telangana along with four other states, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Mizoram, Chhattisgarh will be announced today. The election results are considered to be the semi-finals to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.</p>

<p>A grand alliance of Congress, Telugu Desham Party (TDS), Communist Party of India (CPI), Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) named Prajakootami &nbsp;(People&rsquo;s front) was formed with an objective of defeating the ruling TRS in the elections. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) are the two other parties on the battlefield. Sixty is the magic number required to form the government in the 119 member Telangana assembly.&nbsp;The state recorded a turn out of 73.2 per cent of voters and if the numbers are in favour of TRS, then K Chandrashekar Rao will return to power and form the government.</p>

<p>The regional players in Telangana have also lined up programs for the state&rsquo;s D-Day. The channels also have hiked their advertisement rates for the day. On the other hand, a few channels are planning to go for limited advertisement space telecast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to industry experts based in Hyderabad, the channels have raised their advertisement rates by 20-80%. &ldquo;The channels have come up with premium package for the advertisers on the counting day. There will be a huge rise in the advertisement rates and there will a high demand for advertisement space in the morning slots. There will be a spike of more than 20-60 % from the actual advertisement rate,&rdquo; said a senior media planner based in Hyderabad.</p>

      <article><p><p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Sir Martin Sorrell is in India with plans to shop for agencies in content, data, and media planning space. According to Sorrell, these three sectors are the main focus areas of S4 Capital and he will be interested in pure independent digital agencies and agencies that have broken away from networks and large agencies. Sorrell hopes that his company S4 Capital is seen as a new kid on the block with a different strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Speaking at an event in Mumbai on Monday evening, Sorrell said that version 3.0 of his avatar will be all about technology. &ldquo;The 10 most important companies right now are Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tencent, Alibaba, Apple, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, and Adobe. I would like S4 to be a royalty of the growth of all those companies.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Calling Google, Facebook, Amazon, Tencent, Alibaba, Apple, and Microsoft &lsquo;seven sisters&rsquo;, he said the last time a group of companies was referred to as &lsquo;seven sisters&rsquo; was with the oil giants. &ldquo;Jeff Bezos is like the John D Rockefeller of today,&rdquo; he said. Sorrell noted that the last bunch of &lsquo;seven sisters&rsquo; were regulated and the same might happen to the current &lsquo;seven sisters&rsquo;.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Sorrell broadly spoke about the pressures on the agency business and the disruptions that are shaping the market. He said that agencies are mainly suffering because of pressure from clients and not only because of &lsquo;frenemies&rsquo; like Google &amp; Facebook, competition from consulting companies, and in-housing.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Sorrell felt that mergers of legacy agencies with digital agencies like in the case of JWT with Wunderman and VML with Y&amp;R may affect the brand and image of the older and more established agency. &ldquo;JWT is more well-known in India than Wunderman. Now if people call it Wunderman, there could be a problem. I do believe in the strength of the brands and they have value,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">In the face of the large-scale mergers that WPP has initiated over the last few months, Sorrell said that the senior management of a multinational company like WPP should visit other markets. &ldquo;The senior management of WPP has not visited Latam and Asia in the last six months. If you are going to make structural changes that result in losing 7,500 jobs out of the 135,000 jobs you have, there is a responsibility to visit those places and explain the decision.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Prior to his India trip, Sorrell&rsquo;s S4 Capital bought San Francisco ad tech company MightyHive. It was his second acquisition since leaving WPP and setting up S4 Capital. He made his first acquisition in July with a &euro;300m deal to buy Dutch company MediaMonks.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Before Sorrell arrived in Mumbai, he attended the pre-wedding celebrations of Mukesh Ambani&rsquo;s daughter Isha Ambani in Udaipur.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

      <article><p><p>WPP has announced the results of its strategic review, setting out a new plan to return the business to grow. The strategy reflects a new vision for WPP as a leader in creativity and technology. It incorporates a simpler, improved offer designed to capture the opportunities of a changing marketplace, and a streamlined structure built around the needs of clients. It also includes additional investments in creativity, technology and talent to enhance WPP&rsquo;s proposition to clients and drive top-line growth.</p>

<p>WPP expects to deliver organic growth (defined as like-for-like revenue less pass-through costs growth) in line with its peers at a headline operating profit margin (excluding associates) of at least 15% by the end of 2021 as a result of the strategy. The company will incur cash costs for restructuring of &pound;300m over the next three years to deliver estimated annual savings of &pound;275m by the end of 2021, approximately half of which will be reinvested in the business.</p>

<p>Speaking about the announcement, Mark Read, Chief Executive Officer of WPP, said&nbsp;&ldquo;What we hear from clients is very consistent: they want our creativity, and they want us to help them transform their business in a world reshaped by technology. This is at the heart of what we do. &ldquo;We are fundamentally repositioning WPP as a creative transformation company with a simpler offer that allows us to meet the present and future needs of clients. This more contemporary proposition has already helped us to win new business, including Volkswagen&rsquo;s creative account in North America.&quot;</p>

<p>He continued, &ldquo;The restructuring of our business will enable increased investment in creativity, technology and talent, enhancing our capabilities in the categories with the greatest potential for future growth. As well as improving our offer and creating opportunities for clients, this investment will drive sustainable, profitable growth for our shareholders.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We describe our approach as &lsquo;radical evolution&rsquo;: radical because we are taking decisive action and implementing major change; evolution because we will achieve this while respecting the things that make WPP the great company it is today&quot; he added.</p>

<p>WPP is hosting a presentation for investors and analysts&nbsp;at its new headquarters in London.</p>

<p>Key points of the presentation, which will also be webcast, include:</p>

<p><strong>Opportunities in a Changing Industry</strong></p>

<p>Technology is rapidly reshaping our sector, presenting challenges but also opportunities. We believe the industry is facing structural change not structural decline. WPP is adapting at speed to capture these opportunities and to become even more client-centric than it is today.</p>

<p>Vision, Purpose and Identity</p>

<p>WPP&rsquo;s vision is to be a creative transformation company, bringing together creativity and expertise in technology and data &ndash; with the purpose of building better futures for its people and clients. This competitive positioning was developed in consultation with our people and clients, and is supported by a refreshed brand identity created by WPP agencies Superunion and Landor.</p>

<p><strong>Simpler, Improved Offer</strong></p>

<p>WPP&rsquo;s future offer will cover four areas: communications, experience, commerce and technology. Each of these areas is critical to success for modern clients, and by bringing them together the company will better serve clients&rsquo; needs as they react to the changing marketplace, and expand WPP&rsquo;s own business in high-growth sectors.</p>

<p>&bull; Communications focuses on advertising, content, media, public relations and public affairs, and healthcare.</p>

<p>&bull; Experience reflects the growing need of clients to create a new brand, product and service experiences.</p>

<p>&bull; Commerce allows WPP to expand its growing omnichannel commerce business and its work with brands to help them succeed in marketplaces such as Alibaba and Amazon.</p>

<p>&bull; Technology underpins WPP&rsquo;s work with both CMOs and CIOs to build and operate marketing technology that supports their consumer- and customer-facing activities.</p>

<p>The areas of experience, commerce and technology already represent approximately one-quarter of WPP&rsquo;s revenue.</p>

<p><strong>A Renewed Commitment to Creativity</strong></p>

<p>WPP&rsquo;s most important competitive advantage is its creativity. It is what makes WPP special and what differentiates it from other professional services firms. WPP has significant creative strengths, having won the &ldquo;Holding Company of the Year&rdquo; award at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity for seven consecutive years between 2011 and 2017 &ndash; but the business must invest more in this area. As part of this strategic review, WPP is making a renewed commitment to creativity, investing an incremental &pound;15m a year for the next three years in creative leadership, with a particular focus on the United States.</p>

<p><strong>Technology, Data, Partners </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> Platforms</strong></p>

<p>Alongside creativity, the company will accelerate and promote its technology and data capabilities as clear sources of competitive advantage to WPP. They will follow a consistent approach across WPP by adopting a common technology strategy, leveraging the strengths of our unique technology partnerships, and making our significant existing capabilities in marketing and advertising technology available to all WPP companies for the benefit of our clients.</p>

<p><strong>Simpler Structure</strong></p>

<p>WPP has become too unwieldy, with too much duplication. As a result, it is not always as focused or as a fleet of foot as it needs to be to satisfy the needs of clients around the globe. Therefore, central to the new strategy is a simpler structure, built around the needs of clients, to allow easier access to WPP&rsquo;s many resources. The structure is based on three principles:</p>

<p>&bull; Clients: we will become a more client-centric organisation in order to deliver the best of WPP.</p>

<p>&bull; Companies: we will have fewer, more integrated companies equipped to adapt to a changing market.</p>

<p>&bull; Countries: we will integrate further at a country level to leverage our strengths in individual markets.</p>

<p><strong>Kantar</strong></p>

<p>As previously announced, the Board of WPP has decided to develop Kantar with a potential strategic or financial partner, with WPP retaining a significant minority interest and strategic links with Kantar. Proposals will be evaluated on their financial and strategic benefits and if a transaction is agreed it is likely to be announced in the second quarter of 2019. Preparations are well underway and we have received numerous unsolicited expressions of interest.</p>

<p><strong>Leadership, Talent and Culture</strong></p>

<p>For the first time, WPP has established an Executive Committee drawn from both corporate and company leadership. This Executive Committee will work together to implement the new plan, and we will review the company&rsquo;s incentive arrangements to align with the strategy. To make WPP the natural home for the best and brightest, and to attract the next generation of talent, we will champion a culture across WPP characterized by the values of openness, optimism and a commitment to extraordinary work.</p>

<p><strong>Progress to Date:</strong></p>

<p>Since April this year, the company has made consistent progress towards our goals. This includes the creation of the integrated networks VMLY&amp;R and Wunderman Thompson; the alignment of our US healthcare agencies with integrated agency partners; and the elimination of the sub-holding company WPP Health &amp; Wellness. VML, Y&amp;R, Wunderman, J. Walter Thompson and WPP Health &amp; Wellness collectively account for 23% of WPP revenue. WPP has also disposed of 16 non-core investments and associates, raising &pound;704m to reduce our debt.</p>

<p><strong>2018 and 2019 Outlook:</strong></p>

<p>WPP anticipates reporting full-year results in line with consensus expectations, with full-year like-for-like revenue less pass-through costs growth now expected to be closer to -0.5%. The company is beginning a multi-year improvement programme and 2019 will be a year of investment in the business with the execution of our cost-savings programme and further actions taken to return the company to long-term sustainable growth.</p>

<p>Previously announced account losses will create the anticipated headwind, particularly in the first half of the year.</p>

<p><strong>Restructuring and Investment:</strong></p>

<p>The company will incur cash costs for&nbsp;of &pound;300m restructuring over the next three years, reflecting actions to position the company for growth, address under-performing units and streamline our operations. The actions include:</p>

<p>&bull; The integration of VML and Y&amp;R, and Wunderman and J. Walter Thompson.</p>

<p>&bull; Right-sizing and disposal of under-performing businesses.</p>

<p>&bull; Closure of unsustainable operations.</p>

<p>&bull; Further development of Campus co-locations.</p>

<p>&bull; Establishing a consistent, shared service infrastructure to support 30 countries over the next five years.</p>

<p>The annual savings from the actions are anticipated to be &pound;275m by the end of 2021. WPP will reinvest approximately half of these savings into 2019 to 2021.</p>

<p><strong>Future Capital Allocation Policy</strong></p>

<p>The company has made good progress on its divestment of non-core assets, raising &pound;704m from 16 disposals to date. We continue to target a reduction in average net debt to EBITDA ratio to within our revised target range of 1.50-1.75x by 2021. Over the next three years, WPP will prioritise the dividend over share buy-backs and will balance targeted M&amp;A with divestments. The Board anticipates declaring a final dividend of 37.3p at the Preliminary Results to deliver a full-year dividend for the current financial year of 60p which it intends to maintain.</p>

<p><strong>Medium-Term Financial Targets</strong></p>

<p>As part of the strategic review, WPP has set out new medium-term financial targets that will allow the company to invest in talent and technology, improve its competitive position and deliver sustainable long-term growth rates. These are as follows, to be achieved by the end of 2021:</p>

<p>&bull; Organic growth (defined as like-for-like revenue less pass-through costs growth) in line with peers</p>

<p>&bull; Headline operating profit margin (excluding associates) of at least 15%</p>

<p>&bull; Free cash flow conversion1 of 80%-90%</p></p><header><h1>WPP to spend £300m over three years for restructuring</h1>

      <article><p><p>GroupM has announced that Himanshu Shekhar will be taking over from Ed Thesiger as the CEO of GroupM Indonesia, effective January 1, 2019.</p>

<p>Shekhar has been based in Indonesia since March 2010 when he joined as the Managing Director for Mindshare&rsquo;s business with Unilever. He was later promoted to CEO of Mindshare Indonesia in December 2011.</p>

<p>While at the helm of Mindshare Indonesia, he consistently delivered strong growth for the agency and positioned Mindshare as the market leader in digital transformation. In January 2015, Shekhar was promoted to his current position, CEO of Mindshare South East Asia, the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>Thesiger, CEO GroupM Indonesia and Vietnam, will be relocating to the UK at the end of March 2019 to set up his own consulting business.</p>

<p>Commenting on the appointment, Mark Patterson, CEO GroupM APAC, said, &ldquo;Indonesia continues to be a key growth market for us, and I am delighted that we have been able to promote from within for this important leadership position. Himanshu has a proven track record with a depth of experience and industry relationships that is second to none in that market.&nbsp;I would also like to thank Ed for his energy, passion and outstanding leadership over the past seven years.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are sorry to see him leave the region and wish him every success on his new venture back in the UK.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amrita Randhawa, CEO Mindshare APAC, added, &ldquo;Himanshu has built Mindshare into a titan of an organisation in Indonesia and driven its strength, reputation and leadership stature across South East Asia. His knowledge of Indonesia and our clients&rsquo; core needs in the market is unparalleled and therefore there is no one better suited to step into the GroupM leadership position. We are rooting for Himanshu&rsquo;s success in this next chapter of his career and are confident that he will continue to be an incredible partner for Mindshare and our client&rsquo;s growth story in Indonesia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking of his promotion Shekhar noted, &ldquo;Leading GroupM Indonesia is a massive responsibility. Across our agencies, Mediacom, Mindshare, Wavemaker and Essence, we have some of the brightest minds working with super successful brands on creating media for business growth. I am thankful to our leadership and teams for building trusted partnerships with clients, media and tech ecosystems over the years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, Indonesia&rsquo;s media is among the most vibrant globally. We have global innovation originating here and best practices taking shape in some areas. Our global networks have been deeply committed to this already, and I am excited to add my efforts to this journey. I am thankful for the trust, and look forward to working together with our wonderful teams and partners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thesiger added, &ldquo;It has been an absolute privilege leading such a talented group over the past 7 years. Himanshu has been a cornerstone of the team for the duration of my tenure and I look forward to seeing him drive the business on to the next level in the coming years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ed will work closely with Himanshu to ensure a smooth transition over the coming weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of Ed&rsquo;s successor in Vietnam and Himanshu&rsquo;s successor will be the subject of separate communications in due course, the company said.</p>

<p>Shekhar will continue to be based in Jakarta with his family and will report directly to Mark Patterson.</p></p><header><h1>Himanshu Shekhar promoted to CEO, GroupM Indonesia</h1>

      <article><p><p>As part of the Quaker Feed a Child initiative that aims to create awareness for the issue of hunger amongst children, Quaker India&nbsp;has released a new, thought-provoking digital film &lsquo;The Last Meal&#39;. Produced in association with Culture Machine, the video takes an authentic social experiment route to bring forth the dichotomy of the world we live in, where the privileged masses take access to food for granted, versus the underprivileged who struggle for each meal.</p>

<p>Capturing a real-life social experiment conducted on the streets of Mumbai, the new digital film for Quaker Feed a Child shows people talking about their love for food and yet struggling to remember their most recent meal. In contrast, the film moves to show children from underprivileged backgrounds immediately recalling their last meal, with some even stating sadly that they hadn&rsquo;t eaten anything. The film ends poignantly with some of the children requesting for a meal, as they are hungry. The film also features celebrated&nbsp;Michelin starred Chef Vikas Khanna making a call to action to all viewers to make their new year special by feeding a hungry child.</p>

<p>Speaking about the initiative, Nobel Dhingra, Brand head - Quaker, PepsiCo India, said, &ldquo;It is disturbing that less than one-third of children in India receive adequate nutrition. Quaker Feed a Child is a social initiative based on a powerful thought that urges us all to make every festival or occasion more meaningful by simply pledging a fistful of nutrition to feed a child. With the new year approaching, we hope that people will choose to share their festive cheer by taking a pledge to feed a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Commenting about his association with the initiative, Chef Vikas Khanna, Michelin-starred Chef said, &ldquo;The problem of hunger and malnutrition in India cannot be solved overnight. If each of us take a step forward to help the underprivileged children, I believe we can take a big leap towards ensuring no child goes to bed hungry. I am happy to be a part of Quaker Feed A Child to raise awareness for this important and heart-wrenching issue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sharique Khan, Vice President- Brand Solutions, Culture Machine added,&nbsp;&ldquo;One of the most unfortunate facts today is that most children in our country do not have access to timely meals to satiate their hunger; which is the most basic necessity to any life form. It is our duty and responsibility, as humans and own beings , to create an awareness and also to do whatever we can in our small way to end this, one child at a time. Culture Machine in association with Quaker, urges its viewers to take a pledge and do their bit for this humane cause.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Quaker&rsquo;s new digital film will feature on Culture Machine&rsquo;s digital platform, Being Indian, and aptly captures how the value of a single meal could differ for those who are food secure and those deprived of food. The film reiterates the vision of the Quaker Feed a Child initiative, that aims to raise awareness for the problem of hunger amongst children, given India has one of the highest rates of hunger among children where one in five children go hungry each day. Till date, Quaker Feed a Child has supported over half a million meals for underprivileged children through Smile Foundation.</p>

This is evident from well-established instances such as&nbsp;MTV Coke Studio and Mahindra Blues Festival among others. In keeping with the&nbsp;changing music consumption pattern, Sony Music updated its Sony Music India Segmentation Study, which now covers 31 unique segments. This</span></span></span><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:106%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">&nbsp;is one of India&rsquo;s first and largest research&nbsp;undertaken to analyze psychographic and demographic profiling of Indian audience&nbsp;based on their music consumption patterns. It offers an interesting insight into the life of a consumer over-laid with their music preferences. Over the last three years the study has helped around 80 brands leverage its power&nbsp;by tying up with the right music artistes. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:106%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">The updated study now uncovers 31 unique segments of music consumers classified under a model called as FECI - Fanatic, Enthusiast, Casual and Indifferent, based on how central music is to their lives. The trend study also researched the usage and consumption habits,&nbsp;spends by teenagers in urban cities, music discovery patterns across age groups, music consumed on daily basis, brands consumers admire and spend on with respect to music and the role it plays in marketing and advertising.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:106%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Around 20&nbsp;brands across categories including&nbsp;Yamaha, Nexa, Hitachi , Amazon and Nykaa have leveraged the updated segmentation study to bring out campaigns that marry the DNA of brands and music artistes. These include Nexa Music Lounge 2018 and 7UP Madras Gig.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:106%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Dcruz is also working with FMCG brand&nbsp;ITC that&nbsp;has still not ventured into the content space. Without divulging much, he says, &ldquo;Through Segmentation Study we have been able to give them insights on how to effectively use music and also helped them choose an artiste.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

We are working on something exciting next year too, and will soon share information on the same.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 8pt"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:106%"><span style="font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;">Online beauty retailer Nykaa has also lined up a project which is scheduled to be out soon. Hitesh Malhotra, Chief Marketing Officer, Nykaa.com, says, &ldquo;We have been working with Sony Music over the last few months and they have been most clear in understanding our marketing and brand objectives. &nbsp;This year we are planning something new and innovative with them through their segmentation study and we are confident that it will be a massive success.&rdquo; </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:8.0pt; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#222222">&ldquo;So we changed our thinking and instead of having chief creative officer, we thought why don&rsquo;t we have digital ambassadors. We started in all places. In the factory, we had all machines digitally integrated. Instead of having 10 people manning one machine, we have one console that can do the job. There are censors in these machines and we&rsquo;ve been able to get lots of data. We have also moved from annual maintenance to predicable maintenance. Today, there is GPS, Google map, big data out there. There isn&rsquo;t just one function but so many. So we haven&rsquo;t cracked it all. It&rsquo;s just the start,&rdquo; exclaimed Iyer.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#222222">Iyer said a team at Mondelez works on what could be the possible disruptions that might hit the industry. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:8.0pt; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#222222">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a painting. You could paint on canvas, paper or wall. A lot of people ask me, &lsquo;Are you making a digital commercial?&rsquo; And I tell them that I can&rsquo;t understand the question. It&rsquo;s the same commercial which is played on TV, a movie hall. It&rsquo;s a question of who am I talking to.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

And this is a creative issue. &ldquo;Here we are involved only with the painting.&rdquo; </span></span></span></p>

World over, tell me one election prediction that got it right?&rdquo; &nbsp;He pointed out that it&rsquo;s all about gut and observations. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m watching or observing is being depicted in my commercials,&rdquo; he said.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:8.0pt; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#222222">When Anandan was quizzed on his three predictions for future, he said that AI and machine-learning will impact every industry. He gave the example of the first driverless taxi service which has been launched recently. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:8.0pt; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#222222">&ldquo;It is a true amplification of AI. It goes back to what can machines do better than humans? Machines can now do a lot of things better than humans. Today you can listen to music which has actually been created by a machine. Machine can predict better than an ophthalmologist.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:8.0pt; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#222222">Apart from the prediction that AI and machine-learning will dramatically impact industries, Anandan shared that the way we think about life is going to change drastically as we go forward.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

You will start seeing new kinds of social model developing in the world and the way we think about world today will change.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:8.0pt; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#222222">Addressing the issue of social media&rsquo;s impact and technology players using data, Anandan shared that you can go to My Account at Google and can figure out what data Google has access to and can also wipe it out. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:8.0pt; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#222222">&ldquo;Being able to give users the ability to control their data is very important. Platforms should take care they don&rsquo;t use data in the way they shouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He also added that Google is working on a concept for segments who spend a lot of their time online, so that they can tell the machine if they want the network or connectivity to shut down after a point of time. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:8.0pt; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#222222">Anandan said that Google allows people to flag content that is not desirable. It has over 10,000 human reviewers all over to check if it violates any laws. &ldquo;We are trying to make it easier to flag it and are building the infrastructure and capability at Google to review it. We&rsquo;re also training 8,000 journalists how to use technology and write high-quality content.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-top:0cm; margin-right:0cm; margin-bottom:8.0pt; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#222222">When the experts were quizzed on what they would be doing a couple of years from now, Iyer said, &ldquo;I would be selling moments of joy&rdquo;. Pandey exclaimed that he would be creating.</span> </span></span><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:#222222">Anandan</span> said, &ldquo;<span style="color:#222222">Ten years from now, every single person and thing will be connected to the Internet.

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">Zee as an organisation is gearing up to the take the next leap in the media &amp; entertainment space as a &lsquo;global media-tech player&rsquo;.&nbsp; Hence, we are consolidating all our units.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">From a business point of view, the objective of Zee Unimedia was to offer a synergistic solution across ZEEL, ZMCL &amp; the digital business. And this continues in the new scenario. Hence, effectively, there is no change in the functioning of the team.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">As market leaders, the key challenge is to not only grow the market but also garner higher shares in this highly fragmented &amp; cluttered environment. Hence, as the Chief Growth Officer, it is imperative that we evolve newer modes of revenue opportunities that provide effective &amp; efficient solution to the brands as well as help us maintain above-the-market advertising revenue growth rates for ZEEL &amp; ZMCL, which currently is at 20 per cent &amp; 30 per cent, respectively. In this endeavour, our core focus would be to proliferate newer segments of advertisers across the length &amp; breadth of India.</span></span></span></p>

Having said that, it&rsquo;s too early to predict the impact as it&rsquo;s a challenge for broadcasters, LCOs, MSOs &amp; DTH players to educate the consumer about this new beneficial structural change. The backend for this change is a huge challenge for all distribution platforms.</span></span></span></p>

In the long term, it will only help me grow my advertising revenue. How? While BARC will keep giving its ratings, I, through distribution, can find out which channels are in demand. Also, it will benefit niche channels. My assumption is that this may finally lead the conversation towards CPT. Eventually, then the advertising industry will grow.</span></span></span></p>

      <article><p><p>The ninth edition of exchange4media&#39;s India PR &amp; Corporate Communications Awards 2018 is the most extensive and exhaustive awards to recognise the contribution and success of the PR Industry. With five categories and 22 subcategories, IPRCCA 2018 is the path-breaking initiative to salute and recognise the contribution of PR Consultancies and Corporate Communications.</p>

<p>The event is scheduled to be held on December 13 at The Leela Ambience in Gurugram.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The event will also witness an all-day India PR &amp; Corporate Communications Conference 2018. The theme for the conference this year is &lsquo;The importance of integrated communications and its challenges&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The topic for the seventh session at the conference is on &lsquo;Corporate Social Responsibility and Nation building; how communication supports in building blocks, bridging the gap between social responsibility and political governance&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Our esteemed speakers Sameer Bajaj, Director - Corporate Communications and External Affairs, Discovery India and Dr. Ranjana Kumari, Director, Centre for Social Research, will discuss how brands are sensitive towards society and its development. Government initiative enforced brands commitment towards nation building through human capital. Role of communication person is to ensure CSR falls in line with brands business interest and the impact it has on people. The key is to define and device a key strategy which enhances brands reputation. Media, on the other hand, is a crusader in sensitizing the public about the issues and how corporate and nodal agencies are addressing those issues through their initiative.</p>

<p>Sameer Bajaj has over 20 years of work experience in strategic communications, advocacy, public relations, internal communications and CSR with global organisations across different industries. He is currently working with Discovery Communications India as Director &ndash; Corporate Communications &amp; External Affairs. Prior to Discovery, Sameer has also led Corporate Communications verticals for Amway India and STAR Sports.</p>

<p>A renowned social activist and a prolific academician, Dr. Kumari is also the Chairperson of Women Power Connect. She has dedicated her life to empowering women across the South Asia region and is also a prolific writer of many well-known publications.&nbsp;<br />
Dr. Kumari went to school in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. Her paternal grandfather, a freedom fighter, Pandit Vishwanath Sharma, was the founder member of the famous Kashi Vidyapith of Varanasi, which was the first modern University organised by Indians in British India. After finishing her schooling, she moved to Delhi and did her MA, MPhil, and Ph.D. in Political Science from Jawahar Lal Nehru University.</p>

<p>Her foray into social work was initiated by her concern for a dowry death that took place near her home in 1976. This led to her activism on world famous publication &ldquo;Brides are not for Burning&rdquo;.</p>

<p>She has served as the Coordinator of the South Asia Network Against Trafficking (SANAT) in Persons and is a member of the Central Advisory Board on &ldquo;Pre Conception and Pre Natal Diagnostic Tests Act, 2001&rdquo;, as well as the Central Advisory Committee for Prevention of Trafficking in Women and Children. Some of her most passionate causes have been the participation of women in democracy and governance, the termination of dowry practices and dowry-related violence, and the abolition of female foeticide.</p>

<p>In the past, she was a member of the Task Force on Industrial Relations for The International Labour Organisation (ILO) in Geneva and worked as a senior professional at United Nations. Currently, she is a member of the Global Safety Advisory Board of Facebook. She is also a member of the Twitter&rsquo;s Trust &amp; Safety Council.</p>

      <article><p><p>Rajan Anandan, VP, South East Asia &amp; India, Google is IMPACT Person of the Year 2018 for being a dynamic leader in India&rsquo;s digital ecosystem, accelerating innovation, growing Internet adoption, enabling vernacular language access of the Internet and making &lsquo;Internet for every Indian&rsquo; his mission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At Google&rsquo;s headquarters in Gurgaon, Anandan, the company&rsquo;s leader in India and South-east Asia, is affable and charming as he settles in for this interview. Google India is profitable, its many initiatives to help people use the Internet to better their lives are taking off and Anandan&rsquo;s mission &ndash; to get every Indian on the Internet &ndash; has begun in right earnest. Therefore, it is a happy Anandan who talks to us, quick to slip from poking fun at himself to seriously dwelling on life, leadership and lessons learnt.</p>

<p><strong>The first time I used the Internet, I actually didn&rsquo;t know it&hellip;&nbsp;</strong><br />
Working on programming at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&rsquo;s Athena labs in Cambridge in the early 1990s, the first time I used the Internet, I actually didn&rsquo;t know I was on the Internet! It was before the launch of the commercial Internet as we know it, and it wasn&rsquo;t called &lsquo;the Internet&rsquo; at the time&hellip; that&rsquo;s my earliest recollection. And then when the commercial Internet arrived, Netscape, Yahoo Mail&hellip; I remember buying some books in 1997-98 after Amazon had launched and having them delivered&hellip; it was a magical experience&hellip; how you could order something and get it delivered at your doorstep. It&rsquo;s incredible to see how the Internet has evolved.</p>

<p><strong>As a child, I actually wanted to be a pilot&hellip;</strong><br />
When I was a child, I actually wanted to be a pilot, and fly planes. In fact, when I was 16, I actually took all the pilot training classes, but I was told afterwards that I was too young to actually take the test for a pilot&rsquo;s licence. So, I lost interest in it and moved on to other things, otherwise I would probably have been flying Jet Airways or something!</p>

<p><strong>There is no one model of great leadership&hellip;&nbsp;</strong><br />
There are many different models of great leadership&hellip; no one model... What&rsquo;s important is for everyone to find their authentic style of leadership, instead of trying to copy a style or a model because it&rsquo;s successful&hellip; For me, a few things have been important. One, the ability to have a long term vision, being able to say, &lsquo;This is where we want to go&rsquo;, and &lsquo;This is why we want to go there&rsquo;. Two, being able to build very strong teams&hellip; I think leaders build teams because at the end of the day, that&rsquo;s how you can actually build scale and velocity&hellip; Three, it&rsquo;s very important to communicate clearly and communicate often, and without ambiguity. Four, it&rsquo;s important for leaders to listen, and to be open to feedback, even if it is critical, and then be able to act on that feedback. The best leaders probably speak less and listen more. Five, the ability to quickly absorb data, listen to different points of view and make decisions quickly is very important in this technology era, because if you don&rsquo;t make that decision, something would have happened, and before you know it, you are out of business. Lastly, being humble is very important.</p>

<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t think I have become a leader yet&hellip;</strong><br />
I don&rsquo;t think I have become a leader yet, I am still working on it! You become better every day and at some point, may be you become reasonably good. I wouldn&rsquo;t say leadership but I started managing people when I was in my early 20s at McKinsey, where I became an engagement manager. That was the first time where I actually had to convince other people, depend on them to do things collectively and get things done. It was an incredible experience. I learnt how to motivate people, how to inspire them&hellip; I have had this incredible privilege of having worked with truly inspiring leaders that I have learnt a lot from. My view is, you can learn from everybody. And you should also seek out opportunities where you can learn from teams, from leaders&hellip; I am just very fortunate that I started my career at McKinsey with a set of really awesome leaders. Since then too, it&rsquo;s been a journey of learning from other leaders.</p>

<p><strong>Forcing ads on people - that idea&rsquo;s time is gone&hellip;&nbsp;</strong><br />
It&rsquo;s a very exciting time to be in the advertising and media ecosystem because there is so much change around us. On one hand, consumer behaviour is changing very dramatically and we have on an average 400 million Indians who are spending 3-4 hours a day connected to the Internet. What they are doing online is changing. You have to deeply understand those changes to change your strategies. The new set of digital technologies is much more measurable - the effective ROI that you can get from them is very interesting. Programmatic is fascinating. There are going to be things that machines can do better than people. Machines can buy much more efficiently at scale than many people can. Creating and serving 10,000 creatives instantly across an audience is possible today. Hyper-targeting, hyper-personalization, hyper-efficiency, hyper-creatives at scale, targeted creatives at scale&hellip; it&rsquo;s slowly moving towards this idea of &lsquo;segment of one&rsquo; - please show me an ad that I want to see when I want to see it and let me control whether I want to see it or not. True view is a fantastic format because you decide whether you want to watch the ad or not. I don&rsquo;t watch mainline media anymore because I don&rsquo;t want to watch things I don&rsquo;t want to watch. This idea of forcing ads on people &ndash; it&rsquo;s time has gone.</p>

<p><strong>I resonate with Google&rsquo;s moonshot thinking&hellip;</strong><br />
I resonate a lot with Google&rsquo;s moonshot thinking&hellip; the idea of 10x thinking. Most companies are trying to improve things 10%, trying to grow 10%, trying to reduce cost by 10% as opposed to 10x. The core belief around moonshot thinking is something that I deeply value, and I have tried to imbibe it in what we do, both personally as a leader, but more importantly in our teams. So, when we launched the &lsquo;Internet Saathi&rsquo; initiative, we said, &lsquo;India has 6,00,000 plus villages. We want to get to 300,000 villages with a physical network of &lsquo;Internet Saathi&rsquo; in three years&rsquo;. We have to remember we are Google, a digital company, and we don&rsquo;t build physical networks of anything. And that we were going to do exactly that, was really a moonshot idea. Over the next year, we will certainly reach that target. We have embarked on many moonshots; some have worked, some have not. Another leadership philosophy is that it&rsquo;s really important to take a risk. I never &lsquo;play it safe&rsquo;. People always remember the things you did well and your big successes. The only person who obsesses about all the other things, all the times you failed, is actually you. So, I don&rsquo;t agonize about failure. I just focus on trying to go for the big wins.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are Google&rsquo;s ambitions in India, and what is on your priority list right now?</strong><br />
Our mission for the last several years has been Internet for every Indian. So, we said this when India only had about 100 million users. Today, we are at 400 million Internet users and we have over almost a billion Indians to go. There are more than 900 million Indians who are not connected to the Internet. So, everything that we are doing in India is focused on how do we get Internet for every Indian. We have developed a very deep understanding of all the challenges and barriers there are to getting Indians online, and we are addressing them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Recently you identified voice, video and vernacular as the three driving forces of the Indian Internet ecosystem. How has the Internet landscape evolved of late?</strong><br />
The Indian Internet ecosystem has changed pretty dramatically over the last few years. As we speak, we have 400 million monthly active users on the Internet. One thing that we have observed over the last year or so is that a large number of Internet users who come to the Internet for the very first time are now accessing it primarily through voice. It&rsquo;s a combination of voice technology or voice access getting much easier, both on regular smartphones like Android, and also Jio connected phones. Most people would much rather speak than type. And as computer technology has got very big on voice, that&rsquo;s become the primary access point. Video is really exploding. We have over 250 million active users on YouTube in India. As mobile broadband has become more affordable - a gigabyte of 4G data has gone down from Rs 250 to Rs 25 a month. Video consumption has gone from being very expensive to quite affordable, and that&rsquo;s driven this explosive growth in video. Lastly, local languages - these new Internet users are accessing the Internet and consuming content in local languages, both in video as well as text. So, 100% of new users that are coming on to the Internet today are only proficient in their own Indian languages, be it Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, Bangla or others. So, these are three very interesting trends among the new set of users who are coming online today.</p>

<p><strong>How is the video explosion in India different to what is happening around the world?</strong><br />
It&rsquo;s different in a couple of interesting ways. First, there is just a lot more consumption of video. About 75% of data consumption on the Internet in India is video, and that&rsquo;s very different to where India was a few years ago. It&rsquo;s been entirely enabled by the affordable broadband revolution in India. The first thing that new Internet users do in India is consume video. India is the world&rsquo;s first &lsquo;video first&rsquo; and &lsquo;voice first&rsquo; Internet. I don&rsquo;t think there is a single country in the world where you can get a gigabyte of data for Rs 25. And that&rsquo;s really driven this massive explosion in video.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s predicted that by 2020, India will have more than 600 million people online. What does a connected society of that size and scale mean to you? And what are the opportunities&hellip; what can you expect to make of it?</strong><br />
We will certainly be at well north of 600 million users by the time we get to the end of 2020. But, even at 600 million, we are still less than half of India. The most important part of this is the consumers who are connected to the Internet. Internet in India is going to enable all users to get access to very high quality basic services to which many Indians today can&rsquo;t get access. For example, if you take education, we don&rsquo;t have enough schools, we certainly will never have enough teachers, enough physical schools to be able to deliver very high quality education. But, with digital, especially with data becoming much more affordable, you can actually develop and deliver very high quality education through online tutorials to hundreds of millions of Indians at scale. For something basic like learning English, India will never be able to build enough centres, or have enough English teachers. If you really want to have 500-600 million Indians proficient in English compared to 200 million today, the only way to do that is through digital. Even in healthcare, India will never have enough hospitals &ndash; but somebody sitting in a small village in Karnataka can get access to the best doctors sitting in Bangalore or for that matter anywhere in the world if they are connected to the Internet. Access to affordable healthcare is going to increase. Internet is going to be an enabler in many ways, beginning to solve some of India&rsquo;s more severe challenges that also become opportunities, especially for Indian start-ups. For brands and marketers, it&rsquo;s already a scale medium with YouTube at 250 million users. Today it&rsquo;s got more reach in urban India than any TV channel. But, it can be very targeted, so you don&rsquo;t have to target all 250 million. You can target basically the 10 million Indians who are going to buy a smartphone next month, and just target them with the messaging that you want. How brands will drive engagement, how they will acquire users as well as how they will support and service and engage after purchase with consumers will change dramatically. There will be an extraordinary opportunity for brands to do things very differently.</p>

<p><strong>With Google on every smartphone, sometimes users get a feeling that their privacy is invaded. Google knows everything. Is our data safe?</strong><br />
We take privacy very seriously; consumer privacy and consumer safety are most important for us. Many still don&rsquo;t know that you can actually go to Google and see all the data that Google has on you as a consumer, and we give you the option to delete all that data at the tap of one button. Or you can take the data and import it to wherever you like. One, we want to be very transparent on what data we have on you. Two, we want to be transparent on how we use the data that we have on you. And three, and most important, we want to give you control. You should control the data that any platform has about you, and you should control whether or not you want that platform to have the data and what they use it for.</p>

<p><strong>Can you tell us about some of the non-traditional or regional advertisers that are coming on board? And what are the things that they are doing differently?</strong><br />
There are 51 million small businesses in India. Only a few of them advertise on any medium today. About 10,000 of them advertise on Television, 1,50,000 advertise on Print. And today 2,00,000 advertise on Digital. So, the real advertising story in India is going to be about how do we get this medium Digital to become the first, probably the only way in which 20-30 million small businesses will advertise, because those advertisers want a medium that is easy, and extraordinarily focused on return on investment. They also want a medium that is very interactive. They want to run an ad now and get a lead in the next 30 minutes as opposed to run an ad now and see brand metrics improve. So, that is one very big story that is evolving in India today. But then, lots of traditional advertisers are doing some very interesting things, especially leveraging YouTube as a platform as well as programmatic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Advertising contributed a huge 69% to Google&#39;s turnover with Google Search ads continuing to be the go-to place for digital advertisers in India. But the digital advertising market in India is still very small. What are the factors preventing it from taking off?</strong><br />
We&#39;re focused on helping advertisers get the most out of their online spends. There might be any number of reasons why a marketer hasn&#39;t tried digital yet. What we do know is that once marketers give it a go, digital&rsquo;s mix of transparent, measurable results speaks for itself. There is a growing realization that Internet today is not just a marketing channel - it is influencing purchase decisions and marketers are now looking at digital to drive revenue growth. In fact, many auto companies are shifting their marketing spends from Print to online. In 2017- 2018, in categories like Auto and Banking, Financial Services, and Insurance (BFSI), there was even a direct correlation between online research and offline purchase: 20% of sales in a leading auto original equipment manufacturer (OEM) were driven by digital. In fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) and banking, consumers relied on digital throughout their purchase journeys, leveraging search to discover products and educate themselves before converting online.&nbsp;<br />

      <article><p><p>Nabankur Gupta (NOBBY), a marketing industry veteran, was a master in adding a high level of professionalism wherever he went. Warmth, humility, kindness personified him.</p>

<p>I first met Nabankur Gupta when he was at Videocon. (I was with the ad agency). He developed strategies for sub-branding and multi-branding in the consumer durables business for the first time in India which won him international accolades. Advertising Age International, New York recognised him for this successful initiative by awarding him with the title of &ldquo;Marketing Superstar&rdquo; (amongst 20 recipients of this title in 1996 in the world).</p>

<p>Mr Gupta...a client first then my boss and above all a mentor...who I owe a lot to. He was always there to guide, support me. He initiated my move to Raymond.</p>

<p>Mr Gupta joined the Raymond Group (from Videocon) as the Group President and board member in 2000. During his tenure he acquired some highly synergistic companies to support the strategic growth plans - Color Plus, launched designer label Be among others. The retail presence of Raymond grew aggressively, adding new formats across smaller towns in India.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
He re-launched the brands in the textile and apparel space and further reinforced Raymond&rsquo;s leadership position. Brand building was his forte. New advertising campaigns like &quot;Feels like heaven, feels like Raymond&quot; were during his time. The &ldquo;Baby&rdquo; commercial was launched on the cricket platform &ldquo;Champions Trophy&rdquo;. He had an eye for guiding the work with a great sense of the brand core. He brought back the &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo;. He did the Father and Son, Father and Daughter, Man and Puppies ads and many more. The campaign contemporised &ldquo;The Complete Man&rdquo; making him more sensitive, younger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Media consolidation at Raymond and introducing the Corporate Communication cell was his vision. We did some amazing work together-he was always supportive on any path-breaking idea. Dressing TV anchors, owning news segments, print innovations, style guides, the much prized Haji Ali hoardings were in his time. It was 360 degree marketing solutions, including ET Awards for Corporate Excellence initiated by him to synergize with the Raymond core values of Excellence, Leadership, Innovation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr Gupta interacted with media &ndash; both the editorial with interesting insights and their marketing teams, ever ready to hear a new idea at a cost effective solution. As an advertising friend said, &ldquo;The two of you were a formidable and good team.&rdquo; Extremely soft spoken and well-mannered in his handling of difficult situations and he was truly a marketing genius. He represented Raymond on many industry bodies like MRUC, ABC delivering wisdom and experience. He was truly an industry leader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2005, he relinquished the post to start his own management consultancy &ldquo;Nobby Brand Architects &amp; Strategic Marketing Consultants&rdquo;. He was on the Board of many companies, including Raymond.</p>

<p>A warm, good human being who was highly respected by all, irrespective of rank or creed. A gentle leader, a man of principles, a guide and mentor to many, humble, a great professional and a thorough gentleman. His warmth, his quiet demeanour was like none other!<br />
Thank you Mr Gupta for being there!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>At 70, he leaves behind his wife Nita, son Kaustabh and daughter Timira, and a very large family of indebted souls whose lives he touched. RIP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>God, please give his family the strength to bear this immense loss.</p>

      <article><p><p>Pass Pass Pulse, the candy from DS Group, has rolled out another set of three commercials. This takes forward the &lsquo;Pran jaaye par Pulse na jaaye&rsquo; narrative that was introduced with the release of the very first TV commercial.</p>

<p>The TVCs have been conceptualised by J. Walter Thompson Company and the three commercials being released are titled, Astronaut, the Swing &amp; the Bedroom. Each commercial showcases how the protagonists upon seeing a Pulse Candy in their proximity reach out to grab it, even in unfavorable situations.</p>

<p>Speaking on the brand, Shashank Surana, VP, New Product Development, DS Group, said, &ldquo;The Pulse candy has retained number one position, second year in row due to its irresistible taste heightened by a tangy twist. The communication of Pulse is hinged on the temptation to seize a Pulse candy, whatever the circumstances. This three film campaign also highlights the extend people go to get one in &lsquo;Pran jaaye par Pulse na jaaye&rsquo;, situations presented in comical and eccentric plots.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sundeep Sehgal, Executive Creative Director &amp; Vice President, said, &rdquo;The content consumption nature of consumers has changed and Pulse is a brand which is very conscious of this. As a result for this next round of communication we&rsquo;ve created short crisp 10 second commercials that are snackable content for the consumers and also work well from an attention perspective. However the challenge remains to deliver an impactful piece of communication without losing the essence of the brand and I feel this is one such example.&rdquo;</p>

      <article><p><p>BARC India was adjudged the &lsquo;Most Innovative Company in Service &ndash; Medium Enterprise Category&rsquo; at the CII Industrial Innovations 2018 Awards. The company has also been recognised as one of the &lsquo;Top 25 Most Innovative Companies in India&rsquo;. The announcement was made in a ceremony of the 5th&nbsp;CII Industrial Innovation Awards 2018 held in New Delhi on December 3, 2018.</p>

<p>The Industrial Innovation Awards identify and celebrate innovative Indian enterprises across various sectors. The award has been instituted by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), and is one of the most coveted innovation awards in India, BARC said in a statement on Monday.</p>

<p>The winners have been decided after a four-stage process, spanning across eight months. This also included an assessor visit to understand BARC India&rsquo;s robust technology set up on the back of some path-breaking innovations and a presentation in front of an eminent jury.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The company said that the award is a validation of the rigorous and credible measurement system that BARC India has established&nbsp;in a short span of three years. With its robust methodology and constant tech innovations, BARC India has developed a world class system for the TV industry. It can also be recalled that BARC India&rsquo;s BAR-O-Meters were developed indigenously at 1/6th&nbsp;the cost of globally available meters. This ensured scalability as well as ensured that the meters could handle the weather/power/telecom fluctuations which is unique to the Indian market, the statement mentioned.</p>

<p>The other innovation which has helped BARC India achieve the status of Most Innovative Companies is the Panel Management System (PMS). This indigenously developed system has helped in bringing efficiency in the field force that installs, manages and trains the panel homes. This has played an important role in ensuring reporting from the panel homes at par with global standards.</p>

<p>The third innovation is the BIO suite of products which is a visualization tool that provides interactive UI, 90 per cent reduction in output time and helps in faster and better decision making.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shashi Sinha, BARC India Technical Committee Chairman and CEO, IPG Mediabrands, said, &ldquo;BARC India was set up with the aim to give the industry a measurement system that it deserved, and this could not have happened without having a strong technology backbone. The team at BARC India has been able to give the industry a technology marvel which is capable of providing the industry a representative data that helps them take better business decisions. The CII Industrial Innovation Award is proof of the great work done by the team.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>BARC India Chairman Nakul Chopra added, &ldquo;BARC India has been a key-change agent in the viewership measurement space, and its initiatives have already started to redefine the industry. Since its inception, BARC India has tackled several challenges. But, considering we work in a dynamic industry, these challenges are never-ending. The key to success is to constantly keep innovating and be the change-maker. BARC India has been successful in doing so. We are now looking at implementing some key future projects such as Unified Video Measurement and Return Path Data, which will bring another paradigm shift in the industry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>BARC India CEO Partho Dasgupta said, &ldquo;In future, technology will disrupt every single business, be it cement, retail, telecomm, e-comm or media. It is therefore important to keep pace with the changing technology. As is said, in tomorrow&rsquo;s world, the big fish will not eat the small fish, but a fast fish will eat the slow one. We at BARC India firmly believe that innovation is imperative and not a choice. We also believe that it is important to be the fearless first to inspire change and not be a mere follower. I am delighted to see that our efforts have been recognised by CII. We shall continue to empower the industry with our robust measurement.&rdquo;</p></p><header><h1>BARC India bags ‘Most Innovative Company’ award</h1>

Building on the core of this message through the #5MinuteAur campaign, Star Sports and the ministry want India to encourage kids to play for those extra 5 minutes.</p>

<p>The 5 minutes is symbolic, with an assumption that if each child plays a little bit longer, we will add a billion minutes of play every day that has the potential to translate into 50 medals for the country.</p>

<p>Portraying this five-minute agreement between a mother and a child, the aim with #5MinuteAur is to spark a fire in every enthusiast in India to strive for better through sports. Establishing the message that sports builds and defines our personalities, the more we play the better we get. The manifesto, &ldquo;Hum Aaj Aur Khelenge Toh Kal Aur Jeetenge&rdquo; is true not just for the sport we play, but for life itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The success of Khelo India School Games is a testimony to the hunger and multitude of sporting talent in India. Buoyed by the terrific response for Khelo India School Games and with an aim to increase participation in sports across all age groups, we have not just added two sports this year but have also increased the age limit to allow even more enthusiasts to participate and flourish. The &lsquo;5 minute aur&rsquo; campaign is a reflection of the immense strides we&rsquo;ve made and the journey that lies in front of us to make India a truly sporting nation. We hope it will inspire India to work towards incorporating sports as a way of life,&rdquo; said Col. Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs (IC).&nbsp;</p>

<p>To support the Khelo India initiative by the Ministry of Youth Affairs &amp; Sports, Star India has doubled the level of promotion and broadcast coverage for Khelo India Youth Games, Maharashtra 2019. The coverage of the upcoming season will include live telecast in five languages (Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and English) and telecast of all 18 disciplines for both age groups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sanjay Gupta, Managing Director, Star India said, &ldquo;The first edition of Khelo India exceeded expectations and instilled an aspiration for sports amongst the youth in India and now, with &lsquo;5 minute aur&rsquo;, we are aiming to trigger more pro sport conversations to make India adopt sports as a way of life.

      <article><p><p>Guiltfree Industries Limited, the FMCG division of the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group, has launched its latest TVC showcasing the all-new Too Yumm! Karare. With an emphasis on health and without any compromise on taste, the brand has scored yet another sixer with its latest TVC aptly tagged as &lsquo;Bahar se Tedha, Andhar se Seedha&rsquo; starring Virat Kohli.</p>

<p>Conceptualized by Mullen Lintas, the 30-seconder features ace Indian Cricket Captain, youth icon and fitness enthusiast Virat Kohli. The opening scene of the TVC captures a lady walking into an airport lounge, where she notices Virat Kohli also waiting, and munching on a snack. She sits next to Virat Kohli, and opens her own packet of fried snacks and starts eating it. Each describe the taste of the snack they are eating as tasty and crunchy, this makes the lady slightly curious. Putting the suspense to rest, Virat finally reveals that his snack is the new Too Yumm! Karare exactly like hers, but not fried only baked.</p>

<p><em>Too </em><em>Yumm</em><em>! </em><em>Karare</em><em>- Noodle Masala</em></p>

<p>Anupam Bokey, VP Marketing (CMO) RP-SG FMCG said, &ldquo;We are absolutely thrilled about the new Karare launch. This is the 6th innovative product from the house of Too Yumm, which effortlessly marries taste with health. Consumers are more receptive to products that they can relate to. This has driven us to introduce Karare, where we have pushed the taste to a higher level, while still staying true to the core promise of Too Yumm! which is &lsquo;baked not fried&rsquo;. Our campaign idea of &lsquo;Bahar se Tedha, Andhar se Seedha&rsquo; captures the thought of being tasty from outside while still being healthy from inside, very succinctly. We believe this will make our product offering more mainstream and appeal to a much wider set of consumers.&quot;</p>

<p><em>Too </em><em>Yumm</em><em>! </em><em>Karare</em><em>- Munchy Masala</em></p>

<p>Available in unique flavor combinations like Chilli Achari, Garlic Peri-Peri, Munchy Masala, Noodle Masala and Southern Spicy, Karare promises to live up to every craving without sacrificing on flavour. Karare is a step forward in Too Yumm!&rsquo;s journey in catering to the increasing number of consumers who are on the constant lookout for tasty yet healthy snacking options. Baked, rather than fried, exalts the brand even higher as its increased competitiveness in offering a healthier and tastier snacking option.</p>

<p>Reflecting her views on the brand&rsquo;s new product Garima Khandelwal, Executive Creative Director, Mullen Lintas said, &ldquo;With the launch of this new snack in the portfolio, we are taking the competition head-on. To land Too Yumm&#39;s differentiated benefit of being baked and healthier but as tasty as its fried competitive product, we drew reference from the category for the advertising and arrived at the campaign idea - &lsquo;Bahar se Tedha, Andhar se Seedha&rsquo;. We wanted to land that Karare is as twisted and tasty as the competition, but there is only goodness inside.&rdquo;</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/news-photo/ChilliAchari(2).jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 494px;" /><img alt="" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/news-photo/ChilliAchari.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 494px;" /></p>

<p><em>Too </em><em>Yumm</em><em>! </em><em>Karare</em><em>- Chilli Achari</em></p>

<p>Adding to that, Priya Balan &ndash; Sr. Vice President, Mullen Lintas said, &ldquo;Too Yumm Karare campaign is based on a simple insight of how consumers rationalize their unhealthy snacking choice and are cynical about healthier new products because they believe it won&rsquo;t be quite the same palette experience. Our brand ambassador, Virat Kohli charmingly debunks this myth with the line &lsquo;Bahar se Tedha, Andhar se Seedha&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s because Karare is the product format that is a big favorite with consumers but with a key health differentiation by virtue of it being baked, not fried. We are looking forward to exciting times in the category.</p>

      <article><p><p>If you are living in any big megalopolis in India, the odds of you witnessing or even being subjected to rash driving or lawlessness on the roads is pretty high. Be it a two-wheeler or four or even the bulkier ones, each one seems to be in some hurry or the other to reach a destination of their choice with little regard to traffic rules and pedestrian safety. From jumping the red light, to ignoring traffic signs, to over-speeding and lane cutting, virtually every rule in the book is broken when it comes to driving across major roads in India.</p>

<p>In a unique experiment, Renault India partnered with its creative agency Law &amp; Kenneth Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, and decided to monitor the driving habits of motorists across a few important locations. The team installed cameras across key sites and monitored the traffic violations that took place every hour. This experiment was limited to the cities of Mumbai and New Delhi, usually the hub when it comes to evaluating driving patterns of people on the roads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Titled &lsquo;Who are India&rsquo;s Worst Drivers?&rsquo;, the experiment throws the spotlight on a cross-section of vehicle owners spanning bikes, auto-rickshaws, taxis, buses, trucks, etc. Each owner is seen presenting their own assessment on who are the worst drivers on the road with hardly anyone pointing a finger to him/herself. The experiment threw up startling findings that showed there are almost 110 traffic violations per signal / per hour. The initiative further goes on to educate viewers to maintain road discipline and urges them to become agents of change via #RespectTheRoad.</p>

<p>Commenting on the initiative, Virat Khullar, Vice President and Head of Marketing, Renault India said, &ldquo;Renault stands for &lsquo;Passion for life&rsquo; which in a way means easy life for our customers. But for an easy life with cars, one important aspect is to follow the rules defined for driving these cars on road. In India we all face huge traffic issues and true to our nature, all externalise the fault. This campaign is an attempt to portray reality that the traffic situation can only improve if we change ourselves and respect the road.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing his views, Charles Victor, Executive Director, L&amp;K Saatchi &amp; Saatchi said, &ldquo;This initiative - Driving Smiles, is a wonderful initiative by Renault where we try and give back to the world we sell to. From lighting up villages during Diwali to lighting up smiles at an orphanage during Christmas, the initiative has always tried to take a step towards change. What better change to expect than to change the way Indians drive. This little social experiment aimed at showing us that the change needs to begin with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A two part series, the films have been launched only on the digital platform and serves as an educational tool. While the first film questions people on who are the traffic offenders, the second film goes on provide answers to the questions and how we all need to become agents of change.</p>

      <article><p><p style="text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Veedol has launched a new campaign for its flagship brand Take-Off. Lowe Lintas Kolkata, the agency-on-record for Veedol, has conceived the advertising campaign. Take-Off specifically caters to 2-wheeler riders in the country.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"><br />
<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM)&#39;s report for FY2018, the Indian two-wheeler industry has crossed the 20-million unit sales milestone for the first time - registering a growth of approximately 15 per cent over the previous financial year. The road ahead for the two-wheeler industry looks very exciting and promising. Riding on the fast-growing two-wheeler industry, Veedol&#39;s launch of a new campaign for Take-Off appears to be particularly opportune.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"><br />
<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The campaign film focuses on the innate characteristic of young Indians who challenge the status quo and set things right for the common good. The narrative is woven around these purposeful youth of today who see themselves as agents of change, with the inherent power, confidence and intent to make a difference to the society as a whole. Positioning Veedol as a modern, youthful brand, &#39;For The Young Engines of India&#39; acts not just as a new advertising slogan but celebrates India&rsquo;s energetic youth who equitably represent the brand&#39;s values.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"><br />
<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Commenting on the campaign, R N Ghosal, Managing Director, Veedol India, said, &ldquo;The campaign showcases Veedol&rsquo;s full range of motorcycle and scooter engine oils in an upbeat, youthful ambience with an over-riding sense of purposeful action built into the narrative. This would go a long way in enhancing Veedol&rsquo;s imagery, in step with several other brand interventions we have undertaken recently like the launch of the new international packaging. I believe that this campaign is an important milestone in positioning Veedol as a vibrant and youthful brand of choice for emerging consumers&rdquo;.</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"><br />
<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Janmenjoy Mohanty, Regional President, Lowe Lintas, said, &ldquo;While tuning into the larger India story, we were looking for a youth truth that would suitably reflect the current dynamic. Our search led us to the fact that young people are self-starters, who will not wait for things to happen, but effect change themselves. That is what makes them the &lsquo;young engines&rsquo; of a fast-changing India. A belief we reflect in the new communication for Veedol.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"><br />
<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">D K Guha, Executive Director, Lowe Lintas, added &quot;Veedol&rsquo;s new international packaging, as well as the introduction of high-performance oils, provided the perfect moment for launching the new campaign. Set against the backdrop of a young and restless India, the campaign captures the youthful energy and attitude of the millennials -&nbsp;the driving force behind the nation.&quot;</span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify; margin:0cm 0cm 0.0001pt"><br />
<span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The campaign is being actively promoted online and offline.</span></span></p>

      <article><p><p>Dentsu Webchutney, the digital agency from Dentsu Aegis Network, has launched Platinum Days of Love&rsquo;s new season&rsquo;s collection with the campaign #LoveSoRare, a series of 30 digital films inspired by the design story of the collection. The complimentary design of each pair of love bands is brought to life by 30 films that arise from the insight of togetherness amidst individuality.</p>

<p>With evolving times, couple&rsquo;s relationships and their expectations from love are also seeing a change. Modern relationships born out of this change now demand a better understanding of each other, respect for what each person brings to the dynamic, and a sense of individuality that doesn&rsquo;t stop them from coming together. This ability to be oneself while being together is highly sought after and aspirational for young couples, but it isn&rsquo;t easy to achieve. In fact, it&rsquo;s rare.</p>

<p><strong>The Friends:</strong></p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" rel="nofollow" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z0bvHVABRC0" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>Platinum Days of Love celebrates this very kind of modern love, one that is progressive, equal and rare, and their new collection is a reflection of this ethos.</p>

<p>This kind of rare love brought alive through these 30 films, is seen in very relatable differences between couples. She&rsquo;s an environmentalist, he likes to burst firecrackers; he&rsquo;s watching his weight, she tempts him by bringing home delicious desserts. Will it come in the way of love? With wit and gentle humour, the 30 films of togetherness demonstrate how those who have a rare connection don&rsquo;t see differences as something that comes in the way of love, they look at it positively. They know that despite the differences, what they share is rare.</p>

<p><strong>The Cat-Lover:</strong></p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" rel="nofollow" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uy9G21f_Oz8" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>To introduce this idea of rare love, the agency created a Love Score, a test that encouraged people to test their love based on their differences. Ultimately, it was revealed that these differences should be celebrated and will not push you and your partner apart when you share a #LoveSoRare. Once intrigue was built, the agency launched 30 films inspired by the 30 designs that symbolize rare love.</p>

<p>Commenting on the campaign, Pravin Sutar, Executive Creative Director, Dentsu Webchutney said, &ldquo;In a world where brands tend to look at relationships and love with rose-coloured lenses, it was refreshing to create a campaign that adds to the conversation in such a unique and honest way. Through #LoveSoRare, we&rsquo;re asking viewers to rethink what makes their relationship truly unique.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Aalap Desai, Senior Creative Director, Dentsu Webchutney added, &ldquo;Each pair of rings from the collection has a unique design story that that marks the rare bond between a couple. Our 30 days of togetherness is a perfect reflection of this very love.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Baby Conundrum:</strong></p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" rel="nofollow" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFgoB4kIBs4" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>Sujala Martis, Director- Consumer Marketing, Platinum Guild International said, &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s generation is very pragmatic, we can&rsquo;t attempt to sell them a fairy tale that is removed from their reality. But working with today&rsquo;s truths &amp; creating a value system that is aspirational, progressive &amp; yet differentiated is what we aim for. Love needs to be based on a true partnership with openness, honesty &amp; real acceptance of each other&rsquo;s individuality at the heart of it. Putting this into practice, however, is hard and rare to find. A rare love like that deserves an equally rare metal platinum.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>The Biryani War:</strong></p>

<p><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" rel="nofollow" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4GeYULqdbA" width="560"></iframe></p>

<p>This campaign will also give couples an exciting opportunity to win a special dining experience or wedding photoshoot on a purchase of platinum in-store.</p>

<p>The series of 30 videos will be released daily, starting from November 23rd till December 23rd.</p>

      <article><p><p>Radio network,&nbsp;93.5 RED FM has come out with a new concept of having a humanoid robot as a radio jockey. RJ Rashmi, who is the world&rsquo;s first ever Hindi speaking robot, will be seen hosting a show on RED FM.</p>

<p>The show #AskRashmi went on air on December 3 for the first time. As a part of this concept, Robot Rashmi hosts a show with RJ Raunac aka Baua in the morning from 10 am to 11 am&nbsp;and &lsquo;Dilli ke kadak launde&rsquo; RJ Kisna and Ashish in the evening 5 pm to 6 pm.</p>

<p>During the show &#39;Ask Rashmi&#39;, the robot interacts with the callers and responds to their questions. These conversations vary between a plethora of topics like politics, environment, road safety with an understanding of human emotions.</p>

<p>On this first ever concept for the radio industry, Nisha Narayanan, COO, RED FM said, &ldquo;Red FM is always working towards creating exciting content which also has the new age spark to it. It is the first time ever that a humanoid robot will be hosting a radio show in India. Rashmi the robot along with our RJ&rsquo;s go on-air together in a segment called #AskRashmi. We are thrilled to have her on-air and looking forward to two weeks of fresh content for our listeners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rashmi was created by Ranjit Srivastava who belongs to Ranchi. The robot was designed on the lines of Hong Kong&#39;s robot Sofia. Robot Rashmi not only speaks Hindi but can also speak English, Bhojpuri, and Marathi. This is a first of its kind programming and has never been done in the world, let alone India.</p>

      <article><p><p>The #foodie millennial generation in India has been flocking to Taco Bell stores in India all year to relish new twists to their favourite food, such as the Naked Chicken Taco and the Crispy Potaco. For its third product launch in India, Taco Bell went bigger and bolder; and leveled up the customer&rsquo;s food experience from the standardized fast food burgers, sandwiches and wraps.</p>

<p>Taco Bell announced the launch of its latest product innovation &lsquo;Chickstar Wrap&rsquo;, a unique form of star-shaped tortilla, filled with crispy chicken, delicious veggies and signature sauces from the house of Taco Bell. This new product innovation has already proved to be a hit with anyone who enjoys a good burger or sandwich.</p>

<p>The Chickstar Wrap is unique right from its shape to the taste to the ingredients, that it deserved a launch campaign that was unlike any other food type. The brand has joined their consumer base in facing the unshakeable personal small-talk question of &ldquo;Aur bata, what&rsquo;s new?&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The campaign was conceptualized by Taco Bell&rsquo;s agency on record Ogilvy Delhi.</p>

<p>Speaking on the campaign, Sidharth Shukla, Vice President &amp; Head of Digital, Ogilvy Delhi said, &quot;Our insight was based on the fact that for our target audience trying out experiences is essential. It comes out of a &lsquo;want&rsquo; to discover new things and equally from a realization that there is nevertheless a certain rut which has seeped into day-to-day life.&nbsp; An embodiment of these feelings, we felt, was reflected in the numerous &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Aur Bata&rdquo; questions that we receive&nbsp;as we go about our day &ndash; The Chickstar Wrap here is the symbolic answer, counter and come back to this question &ndash; putting a new spin from both a format and a taste perspective to a food item which has largely remained unchanged since we have known it. &nbsp;The film remains true to the Taco Bell style that we are now so familiar with &ndash; slices of life, witty, young, all of which add to making it very relatable to the audience we wish to engage with&quot;.</p>

      <article><p><p>In an endeavour to contribute to the advancement of the environment, Sattviko, a packaged food company providing light snacks of Indian origin, launched a &lsquo;Sattviko wrapper exchange initiative&rsquo; across India. The initiative will commence from the first week of January and will continue for a year.</p>

<p>The wrapper exchange campaign that Sattviko has initiated encourages consumers to avoid disposing of the wrappers of its products but instead, consumers can exchange 10 empty Sattviko wrappers for one free packet of Sattviko snacks. The quantity, size and the flavour of the packets have to be the same as the ones sent by the consumer, via post to Sattviko or to any of its registered retailers.</p>

<p>Speaking of the initiative, Prasoon Gupta, Co- Founder and Director, Sattviko said, &ldquo;India produces around 26,000 tonnes of plastic waste every day. Most of this is single-use plastic that can take up to 100 years to decompose. Plastic causes major environmental damage and a small initiative such as this can make a huge difference. Sattviko intends to reach out to a maximum number of consumers through this campaign. We hope to inspire others to make a difference with such an initiative. This is in support of our fight against plastic pollution and we hope that we are able to bring a behavioural change in the society at large.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sattviko is also looking at proactively&nbsp;spearheading the debate on &lsquo;How can cutting down on plastic in FMCG be functional&rsquo; with an aim to engage consumers and producers, and educating them to avoid the usage of plastic for a better environment.</p>

      <article><p><p>According to media reports, Salesforce and Amazon&rsquo;s cloud arm, AWS, have announced that they are offering a new set of data integration services between the two cloud platforms for common customers.</p>

<p>Customers looking to transform digitally are still primarily concerned about security when moving data between cloud vendors said Matt GarmanMatt Garman, Vice President of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. &ldquo;Customers talked to us about sensitive data in Salesforce and using deep analytics and data processing on AWS and moving them back and forth in secure way,&rdquo; said Garman.</p>

<p>In practice, Salesforce customers can set up a direct connection using AWS Private Link to connect directly to private Salesforce APIs and move data from Salesforce to an Amazon service such as Redshift, the company&rsquo;s data warehouse product, without ever exposing the data to the open internet.</p>

<p>Salesforce customers can set up Lambda functions so that when certain conditions are met in Salesforce, it triggers an action such as moving data (or vice versa). This is commonly known as serverless computing and developers are increasingly using event triggers to drive business processes.</p>

<p>Finally, the two companies are integrating more directly with Amazon Connect, the Amazon contact center software it launched in 2017. Salesforce offers its own contact center services with Salesforce Service Cloud. The two companies found a way to help common customers work together here to build what they are calling AI-driven self-service applications using Amazon Connect on the Salesforce mobile Lightning development platform.</p>

<p>This could involve among other things, building mobile applications that take advantage of Amazon Lex, AWS&rsquo;s bot building application and Salesforce Einstein, Salesforce&rsquo;s artificial intelligence platform. Common customers can download the Amazon Connect CTI Adapter on the Salesforce AppExchange.</p>

<p>Bret Taylor, President and Chief Product Officer at Salesforce said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re enabling something that wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible. It&rsquo;s really exciting because it&rsquo;s something unique in the marketplace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two companies have been working together for some time. As Garman points out, Heroku, which Salesforce bought in 2010 and Quip, which it bought last year were both built on AWS from the get-go. Salesforce, which mostly runs its own data centers in the US runs most of its public cloud on AWS, especially outside the US Conversely, Amazon uses Salesforce tools internally.<br />

      <article><p><p>Digital content studio, Supari Studios, produced the latest campaign for Clinique&rsquo;s Even Better range of products. Bringing on board four diverse influencers, Supriya Joshi, Lisa Mishra, Leeza Mangaldas and Teena Singh, they put together a series of fun and spunky films that offer viewers a glimpse into each influencer&rsquo;s personality. In a candid chat about what beauty means to them, these influencers describe the role that Clinique&rsquo;s Even Better products play in their lives, helping them in achieving their goals. The films use a very realistic tone and are accompanied by polished visuals and catchy music, aiming to fill its viewers with a sense of joy and independence, much like the products themselves.</p>

<p>Speaking about the campaign, Sameer Ghauri, Director of the film said, &quot;Our goal was to keep the tone of the films honest and real, complemented by clean and elegant visuals that are crisply edited to music handpicked to pair with each lady&rsquo;s distinct personality. The colour tone of each film was also meticulously chosen to complement the different skin tones of our influencers. The aim of the films was to celebrate the diversity of smart, independent Indian women and at the same time highlighting that the brand caters to over 50 types of different skin tones, and I feel our films managed to achieve that quite successfully.&quot;</p>

<p>Adding to this, Mitali Sharma, Executive Producer, Supari Studios said, &ldquo;With this campaign, we wanted to focus on the tagline &lsquo;Even Better&rsquo; by bringing out the strong personalities of each of the influencers and how they don&#39;t like to settle in life, just like the Even Better foundation. We tried to encapsulate a piece of their life into the films by throwing in some minimal props that gave a suggestion of their profession. We also highlighted how Clinique Even Better Foundation helps each influencer, by mentioning a specific benefit of the foundation that works for them.&rdquo;</p>

      <article><p><p>While the rest of the world is going gaga about the Black Friday and Single&rsquo;s Day Sale, Indians will not feel left out, courtesy Brand Factory by Future Lifestyle Fashions. Announcing, Free Shopping Weekend (FSW) with a tongue in cheek humour, Brand Factory tells its customers #DontShopAtFSW if they like being rewarded only with discounts.</p>

<p>FSW is every shopaholic&rsquo;s dream as they get to shop for more than 200 National and International brands for FREE! The 3rd season of Brand Factory Free Shopping Weekend will be held from 12th to 16th December 2018.</p>

<p>The last two years of Free Shopping Weekend saw great success, with lakhs of customers queuing up outside the stores. The wait this year was palpable, resulting in more than 1 lakh RSVPs online, on Day 1 itself. Brand Factory rolled out a 360-degree integrated campaign where #DontShopAtFSW campaign received an overwhelming response of over 1.2 million views on Facebook. The campaign is supported by print, TV, digital, OOH, radio along with corporate and student community tie-ups. This year, the event will be held on a scale larger than ever before with the increased store presence in Tier II and Tier III markets.</p>

<p>Speaking about the scale of the Free Shopping Weekend, Roch Dsouza, CMO, Brand Factory says, &ldquo;This is one of our biggest property and we wanted our communication to not only be direct but also fresh and exciting. #DontShopAtFSW is not just an attempt to break the clutter but it&rsquo;s backed by solid consumer insights. We took this route for our digital campaign and both the films bring out the true customer experience when they hunt for deals online or during EOSS of full price retailers. They are as direct and convey the message spot on. We backed this idea with content and we are already witnessing some crazy response.&rdquo;</p>

<p>FSW is India&rsquo;s only national ticketed shopping event conducted in 88 stores and 37 cities. Given the scale of the event, shoppers need to pre-book their entry passes at a minimal cost of Rs.250 (Premium passes for two: for early entry to the store from 8 am) and Rs.100 (Classic passes for two: for entry post 11am). Tickets can be booked via on brandfactoryonline.com, insider.in or by visiting the nearest Brand Factory store. You can also redeem the value of your pass on your next purchase during 18th to 31st December.</p>

<p>During the Free Shopping Weekend, you shop for MRP worth Rs.5000, pay just Rs.2000 and get that back too, in the form of free apparel worth Rs.500, gift vouchers worth Rs.1200, and another Rs.300 in your Future Pay wallet.

G Sreenath, Managing Director, Hammer India, said, &ldquo;In 2011, when Hammer was assigned to design the logo for Kannur international Airport, our creative object was clear. It was to synergize the glory of Kannur&rsquo;s heritage with that of a world class, most modern airport. Seven years hence it is a proud moment for us as Kannur International Airport launches.&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

It will open up a huge corridor in the North Malabar region and take Kerala to never before heights. We also wanted to spread some positivity among the people after the deluge of 2018.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

It has achieved this and more, with the films going viral and being talked about in India and abroad. Potential passengers are now aware of the opening of a state-of-the-art airport in Kannur, and also its proximity to places in Karnataka such as Kodagu and Mysuru. People don&rsquo;t see it as just another modern airport, but as the perfect gateway to North Kerala and South Karnataka,&rdquo; concluded Menon. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

      <article><p><p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">Rajan Anandan, Vice President, Southeast Asia and India, Google, took home the IMPACT Person of the Year 2018 Award, instituted by the exchange4media group to recognise excellence in the advertising, media and marketing domain. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">He won the award for driving Internet adoption across India, especially in Tier II and Tier III towns, through several initiatives including &lsquo;Navlekha&rsquo;, Google&rsquo;s platform for users in India who are not conversant with English, &lsquo;Internet Saathi&rsquo;, an initiative to bring more rural women online, and the Indian Railways high-speed Wi-Fi project, providing free Wi-Fi to consumers at railway stations across the country. He has also been responsible for accelerating innovation in India and Southeast Asia for Google. Under Anandan&rsquo;s leadership, the company saw its profits increase from Rs 306.6 crore in 2016-17 to Rs 407.2 crore in 2017-18, with a total turnover of Rs 9,337.7 crore.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">Commenting on his win, Anandan said the recognition isn&rsquo;t about him but about the incredible Internet users in India.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very humbling to win this award. I congratulate all the other nominees. But this recognition isn&rsquo;t about me. It&rsquo;s a recognition for the incredible Internet users in India and the recognition of the amazing products that Google has and of the amazing team at Google as well as the ecosystem partners we have been fortunate to work with. From the bottom of my heart, I&rsquo;m truly appreciative of being at Google,&rdquo; he said.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">Anandan remarked that India is at an interesting time when it comes technology. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">&ldquo;When it comes to consumer Internet, what we are seeing in India is unparalleled; something that we haven&rsquo;t seen in the history of Internet. We have witnessed a scale of growth and consumer behaviours that we haven&rsquo;t seen before. And this makes it very exciting. There are 400 million Internet users in India and we&rsquo;re adding 8-10 million Internet users every month. As data is becoming more affordable, all of these users are spending more time online,&quot; he explained.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">Anandan shared that the average consumption per user per month has crossed 10 gigabytes. &ldquo;Two and a half years ago, that number was less than one. So we&rsquo;ve seen 20x growth in Internet consumption.&quot; </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">Shedding light on the emerging Internet user behaviour, he said it is largely being driven by voice. &ldquo;The new Internet user wants to speak to the Internet and doesn&rsquo;t want to type.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">He revealed that India has the highest online video market in the world and also pointed out how going vernacular is another trend the brand has taken note of. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">&ldquo;There are over 300 million online video users with watch time growing rapidly. And users today prefer accessing the Internet in their local language,&rdquo; Anandan added. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">Making a case for what Internet is doing for the masses, Anandan spoke about how it is enabling world-class facilities at their fingertips. &ldquo;What excites me the most is what Internet is enabling for the real India. Today, there is an app that uses AI to deliver world-class diagnostics even in the most tiny, remote villages. People can also easily get access to education with many online courses and programmes at their disposal.&rdquo; </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">Speaking about Internet Saathi, Google&rsquo;s initiative to bridge the online gender divide in India, he said, &ldquo;As we started working on it, we learnt that only 10 per cent Internet users in rural area were women. The digital gender divide in rural India was worst.&rdquo; </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">Anandan acknowledged that this stemmed from constraints such as no access to smartphones, societal pressure and lack of understanding of what Internet could do for them. Google decide to give them a smartphone and show them how to use the Internet apart from giving them a stipend, he said.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">In the process, they trained over 20 million women. Through this initiative, he shared, Google gathered insights on what these women actually wanted. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">&ldquo;They want to get access to education for their families, they want to know how they can make more money and want healthcare of their families. Internet is bringing the best of the world to India and is extra-ordinarily relevant to India,&rdquo; he asserted.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin:0cm; margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><span style="color:black">Anandan shared how the power of the Internet converted some of these &#39;internet saathis&#39; into rural entrepreneurs. He highlighted how they didn&rsquo;t know what Internet was able to do for them. But as they learnt how to start a business, they started making 10 times more than what they did earlier. </span></span></span></p>

      <article><p><p>The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity has&nbsp;announced the 27 Jury Presidents that will lead and guide specialist juries at the 66th edition of the Festival. The Jury Presidents span the Cannes Lions Awards architecture, introduced last year, which includes nine Awards Tracks.

<p>Philip Thomas, Chairman of Cannes Lions, said, &ldquo;To win a Cannes Lion demonstrates creative excellence. It&rsquo;s inspiring work that stands out for its innovation, impact and effectiveness. In awarding a Lion, the juries are recognising the best creative output from the year gone by but also signaling the future of creativity. Our Jury Presidents are pivotal in this process, themselves having demonstrated their creative credentials in guiding teams, organisations and brands to set exemplary standards. We&rsquo;re extremely proud to have their talent and experience to lead this year&rsquo;s juries in setting the benchmark for creativity going forward.&rdquo;</p>

      <article><p><p>Bag &amp; accessories brand Baggit has launched its autumn winter campaign titled #PutItOnTheTable with Shraddha Kapoor as a part of their association for the year 2018 &amp; 2019. While the first half of the campaign focused on encouraging women to express their own opinions by putting the issues on the table, the second part of the campaign showcases the fun element of how women sometimes reach a decision or make up their minds when there are multiple options available. The campaign again encourages women to be true to their self.</p>

<p>The campaign will be led with a TVC (20 &amp; 30 seconders) that will be launched on GEC channels followed by hoardings in metro cities. This will be supported by a diverse print and an innovative digital campaign in the coming months that will engage the target audience on a deeper brand level, the company said in a statement.</p>

<p>While the campaign has been conceptualised by Famous Innovations, the TVC has been shot by Curious Films and the print campaign has been shot by ace photographer Prasad Naik.</p>

<p>Commenting on the campaign Nina Lekhi, MD &amp; Chief Design Curator, Baggit, said, &ldquo;Our first ever TVC received immense love and support from all our customers and the industry at large which was very heartening and encouraging. With the second part of our campaign we continue to extend the concept of #PutItOnTheTable and encourage women to take decisions in their own hands &ndash; however difficult or fun they might be. It is their choice, and no one said they can&rsquo;t have fun while making it. The added fun element makes this one endearing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Adding on to it, Shraddha Kapoor, Brand Ambassador, said, &ldquo;The Baggit campaign has been immeasurably satisfying to be a part of. The conversation that it has put focus on has helped women take control of the narrative of their individual story. The next part of the campaign deals with a lot of fun that can also be a part of decision making for women. Especially when it is concerned with fashion, I encourage women to have fun with it and don&rsquo;t apologise for it. Be a part of it. Fearlessly. Unapologetically.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The TVC, print and outdoor campaign will be launched in the month of December.</p>

      <article><p><p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The appointment of Piyush Pandey to the role of Global Chief Creative Officer came in as an important milestone not just for Pandey and Ogilvy India but for the entire Indian advertising community. It puts India on the world map like never before.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Pandey&rsquo;s mentees, competitors, those who have only known him through his work and those who have been working hard hoping that someday he will take notice are all overjoyed over his elevation, which makes him the first Indian to hold such a position.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Here&rsquo;s what some of Piyush Pandey&rsquo;s ardent fans and disciples have to say:&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><strong>Swati Bhattacharya, Chief Creative Officer, FCB Ulka</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">This a matter of huge pride for all of us. Ogilvy is totally wrong if they think Piyush belongs only to them. He belongs to every agency in India. Whichever agency we have all been in, we have thought of him as the unseen creative director whom you want to impress.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">At Cannes this year, when he was winning the Lion of Saint Mark and I was about to win the Gold Lion in the Glass category, he gave me a kiss on my forehead and said &ldquo;Shabaash.&rdquo; That congratulations he gave me and the way he said &ldquo;shabaash&rdquo; recharged my batteries that evening. Last year, I had done an activation for Horlicks Kota. And I was delighted when Piyush included that work in his year-end address on the top five campaigns of the year. I am still flying high.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">His appointment as the global creative chief of Ogilvy also proves that no work is too Indian to be recognised globally. The point is that when you are true to the work you do and the work is authentic, it really doesn&rsquo;t matter. Today, he can guide every other country under the sun because he was so true to his craft. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><strong>Navin Talreja, Co- Founder, The Womb</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Piyush would always say &ldquo;Be so good that people can&rsquo;t ignore you!&rdquo; And I think the network could not ignore this man any longer. It is a moment of great pride for India because he is possibly the first Indian to be the Global CCO of a big network agency. The Lion of India to the Lion of St. Mark to the Lion of Ogilvy is a wonderful journey. And one that gives us all something to aim for.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">I started working with Piyush in 1996 as a Senior AE on Pidilite, and circumstances were such that I worked with him directly. I still remember how I would get a call on Tuesday mornings at 6, asking me to come over to his house because he had an exciting idea on Fevicol or Fevikwik and he could not wait to share it. Why this stands out is that he did the same even when I had become the Head of Mumbai. His consistent energy and excitement around a great idea is still there after everything and that&rsquo;s something that stands out for me.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The biggest thing one learns from him is his ability to keep it simple and real. With the world going crazy around social media, data etc&hellip; his ability to bring all down to a simple idea that will appeal to hearts and minds is inspirational.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">But there is a lot to learn and be inspired about beyond just the work he creates. The ability to define roles of each member of the team, making each person feel valued, having your back, creating an environment that makes you fearless to express, an environment that fosters creativity, his relationships with everyone, and above all, his ability to stay grounded, rooted and humble even after achieving the biggest accolades is something that all of us should learn and be inspired by.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><strong>Anil S Nair, CEO &amp; Managing Partner, L&amp;K Saatchi &amp; Saatchi India</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">This is tremendous recognition for Piyush Pandey and India because he has always put India on the world map with is work. He changed the course of the Indian advertising industry by bringing in non-English and non-Western thoughts and ideas into his work. Since then, even the talent entering the industry has seen a shift away from just the convent-educated lot.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">I have never really worked with him because has been a competitor. But even as a competitor, I have great respect for him. In one of the pitches we did for a client, the client had made a decision to give the job to Ogilvy. When the client told Piyush that the idea from our team looked promising, Piyush requested them to share the idea and upon listening to the idea, he asked them to give the work to us. My respect for him went up 10-fold after this incident. He could have easily dismissed it, but he did not. Eventually Ogilvy and L&amp;K Saatchi and Saatchi shared the client.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif"><strong>Nima Namchu, Chief Creative Officer, Havas Worldwide</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Like a lot of kids of my generation, I was humming along to &quot;Mile Sur Mera Tumhara&quot; playing on TV, long before I even knew who Piyush Pandey was. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Years later, while working on competing brands, one burnt the midnight oil to write funnier stories than the ones he wrote for Fevicol or more insightful scripts like &quot;Har ghar kuch kehta hai&quot;, which he wrote for Asian Paints.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">I&#39;m perhaps one of the unfortunate few who never had the opportunity to work with the big man. Having said that, whenever I have been in the vicinity, he has always responded to my shy nod or a hello with a nod, a broad grin, and on a lucky day, a pat on the back accompanied by a &quot;How is it going? Keep at it!&quot;...</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">From a respectful distance, I have admired how, at award shows, he would stand in the aisle and congratulate every winner coming down from the stage, irrespective of which agency the person may be from...</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">And some clients we pitched for have called apologetically to tell us that while they liked our work, they just couldn&#39;t let the opportunity of working with Piyush pass them by...</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Perhaps the true measure of the man is in the stories told by people who have never worked with him.</span></span></p>

      <article><p><p>At the ongoing 7th CII Big Picture Summit in New Delhi, a panel discussion on &lsquo;Game Changers in Media and Entertainment (M&amp;E) Landscape&rsquo; saw experts debating about challenges and opportunities that are shaping the M&amp;E sector.</p>

<p>Speaking about the rise of streaming platforms and their growing relevance, Karan Anshuman, Director of Web Series, Mirzapur said, &quot;There are several reasons and several factors&nbsp;that are at play over here.&nbsp;One of the reasons could be the medium itself, such as the rise of the short format&nbsp;online. Also, you see some of the best talent in writing, directing and acting&nbsp;gravitating towards&nbsp;television and streaming shows.&quot; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharing that streaming platforms offer more ground for experimentation and that has become its biggest force multiplier, Anshuman added, &quot;Everyone is trying to crack the formula when it comes to films,&nbsp;over here (online)&nbsp;there isn&#39;t any&nbsp;fixed notion of what works or what does not work,&nbsp;so one can be a lot more experimental&nbsp;with what one is doing.&nbsp;This is also giving voice to the bunch of new&nbsp;generation of writers and filmmakers who&nbsp;want to express themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>Commenting on the rise of streaming content platforms and whether it was forcing big filmmakers to rethink about their business model, Shobu Yarlagadda, Producer of the iconic Baahubali franchise said, &quot;The big-budget films&nbsp;will dominate the theatre market.&nbsp; For people to go to&nbsp;theatres,&nbsp;they need big films like Baahubali&nbsp;which can be enjoyed in theatres. But romcoms,&nbsp;dramas, and slice-of-life films are meant for more intimate viewing and can be enjoyed&nbsp;as a personal experience.&nbsp;So they are more conducive to the streaming services&nbsp;and online platforms.&rdquo; &ldquo;There is going to be segmentation of what kind of content is going to be placed where. The big ticket events will go to the big screens.&nbsp; Also, we don&#39;t have enough screens in India and for the rural population the easiest option will be mobile phones,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>According to Neeraj Roy, MD Hungama Digital, streaming consumption will continue to grow since traditional entertainment platforms have an inherent content overlap. &quot;If you look at television,&nbsp;it is not that we have a shortage of channels,&nbsp;we have almost 950 channels,&nbsp;but when you look at the programming that is being done,&nbsp;there is almost 80 per cent overlap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the last two years, we have seen 1500 per cent increase&nbsp;in streaming consumption and it is set to grow further.&quot; When asked if there are there enough revenue models to justify the growing number of streaming platforms, Hiren Gada, CEO, Shemaroo Entertainment said, &quot;At this point, the real challenge that digital is facing is the monetization model,&nbsp;because the base is not yet big enough for big bucks from advertising to kick in. The paid ecosystem on top of that is below one per cent&nbsp;from what we hear see and understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Television is a very high-value service&nbsp;because for 300 rupees you get 400 channels&nbsp;and India is a very value-conscious market,&nbsp;so that is why TV is a&nbsp;deterrent for the digital ecosystem&nbsp;to grow,&rdquo; he added.</p></p><header><h1>Lack of revenue models deterrent to growth of streaming platforms: Experts</h1>

It said, &ldquo;While on one side digital offers a solution-based approach, new ideation, sharper targeting and return metrics, on the other side there are unanswered questions around measurement of ROI and impact, and rethinking multi-platform advertising strategies. This is one of the reasons why monetization of digital media has been a challenge and dollars have moved slower than eyeballs.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

      <article><p><p>With an aim to increase ad transparency ahead of the 2019 India General Election, Facebook has announced changes to the way ads are managed on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

<p>According to a Facebook Newsroom post by Sarah Clark Schiff, Product Manager at Facebook, &ldquo;Now anyone who wants to run an ad in India related to politics will need to first confirm their identity and location, and give more details about who placed the ad. The identity and location confirmation will take a few weeks so advertisers can start that process today by using their mobile phones or computer to submit proof of identity and location. This will help avoid delays when they run political ads next year&ldquo;</p>

<p>The post also says that from early next year Facebook will add a disclaimer to all political ads providing&nbsp;information about who is placing the ad, and an online searchable Ad Library, which can be accessed by anyone. It will contain all political ads from a particular advertiser and will provide information such as the budget of individual ads, as well as the demographics of who saw the ad, etc.</p>

<p>Facebook also said that they will be rolling out a new policy that requires all politically related ads to be run by advertisers who have completed the authorisations process and be labeled with the disclaimer.</p>

<p>However the company will&nbsp;not require eligible news publishers to get authorized, and their ads would not be included in the Ad Library.</p>

<p>Adding that &ldquo;By authorizing advertisers and bringing more transparency to ads, we can better defend against foreign interference in India&rsquo;s elections&rdquo;.</p></p><header><h1>Facebook announces new ad transparency policy ahead of India general election</h1>

      <article><p><p>The world needs heroes. And we all need idols. That&rsquo;s what takes the human race forward. People we can look up to and marvel at. People who blaze a trail we can follow. People whose shoulders we stand upon to see farther than we ever imagined. Larger than life men and women who seem to bend the world to their bidding through sheer force of will. Who we watch open mouthed as they weave their mysterious, powerful magic, and say to ourselves &lsquo;I could never do that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was 1996 and I was working in Sista Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Bombay when I first saw Piyush Pandey. It was at a media party thrown by Prime Sports and ESPN to celebrate their merger. The venue was a 5 star hotel in South Bombay and the theme for the party was, you guessed it, sports. They had created little booths with all kinds of games around a large banquet hall. You got three chances to throw a basketball through a hoop, or you could race remote controlled cars around a slalom course. There was a bowling machine you could bat against and several other games scattered around the room. You could enter a tournament where points were tallied across all games and the one who scored the highest won a prize. Piyush and Sonal Dabral were working their way around the room playing game after game. Like a star struck Mary&rsquo;s lamb I followed at a discreet distance. Piyush was, as usual, cracking jokes and exploding into his trademark laughter from time to time. But when it would come to the game he would put his whisky glass away and focus totally on the task at hand. A furrow of concentration would appear on his forehead and he would transform into the elite sportsman he once was. At the slightest sound or disturbance from the band of followers around him he would whip around with a fierce scowl, cowing us into, pin drop silence.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My god,&rsquo; I thought to myself, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s just a party game and he actually wants to win this.&rsquo; And. then it dawned on me that the great become great through a winning mind-set. Whether it&rsquo;s a multi crore pitch or a game of marbles it is the attitude that takes you on to victory.</p>

<p>Half a decade later I had the good fortune to join Ogilvy Delhi. One day Vibha Desai, our head of office, came to me and my partner Sudip and said that Piyush would like to brief us personally on the Pulse Polio campaign. I was only an Associate CD then and usually it was the Creative heads who would interact with Piyush. It turned out that I was the only senior enough chap who could write in Hindi at that time. I thanked God for my Kendriya Vidyalaya education and couldn&rsquo;t wait to get cracking on the brief. We met Piyush at the Bristol Hotel in Gurgaon. It was our first interaction with him on work and we were nervous as hell. He put us at our ease and offered us breakfast. We spoke about everything but the Polio campaign and then, just before leaving he turned to us and said, &lsquo;Ek idea hai. Mr Bachchan ko Phir se angry young man banate hain. Filmein likho jin mein woh un logon se naraaz ho rahe hain jo apne bacchon ko Polio ki drops nahin dete. Dil se likho Aur Kal tak mujhe Mail Karo &lsquo;. Saying which he got up and left for some meeting.</p>

<p>I reached office at 7.30 am the next morning and started work on the scripts. I wrote them and re wrote them and polished them and pruned them and honed them. Finally they were as good as I could make them and, with a shaking finger, I pressed the &lsquo;send&rsquo; button on mail and sent them off to Piyush. The next couple of hours were the longest of my life. I must have checked the mail 50&ndash;60 times in that duration. Finally a mail from Piyush appeared in my mailbox. Nervously I opened it. There was a three word reply. &lsquo;Very nice scripts.&rsquo; Now I have had the good fortune to win many awards and accolades since that day and even been on stage at Cannes to receive a Gold Lion. But no feeling has come close to the euphoria I felt when I read that three word email from Piyush. I printed it out and kept it in my wallet for years, referring to it whenever I felt a twinge of self doubt, until it became a tattered rag and disintegrated with time.</p>

<p>I have worked with great bosses earlier as well but Piyush goes beyond that. He is a great leader. The difference is, while you&rsquo;re willing to take on any amount of work for a great boss, for a great leader you&rsquo;re willing to take a bullet.</p>

<p>I remember 2008 as the worst year in my life. I lost both my parents that year. There was some film shoot I was supposed to go for. I couldn&rsquo;t go because my dad had just passed away and there was the 13th day ceremony to perform. The client, who shall remain nameless of course, was informed. Under pressures of his own I suppose, he was upset when he heard that I wasn&rsquo;t attending the shoot. He found it unprofessional. The fact that I had lost my dad did not seem to be enough of a reason for him.</p>

<p>When Piyush came to know of this he was livid. He picked up the phone and called his boss. &lsquo;I will fill in for Ajay and come for the shoot&rsquo; he told him. &lsquo;But tell your man not to be in my line of sight. Dikhega toh saale ko maar doonga&rsquo;. Of such impulses and spontaneous gestures are great leaders made. I have no shame in saying that if Piyush asks me to jump the only question I will ask is &lsquo;how high.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Piyush appears to have a double PhD in People and Common Sense. He can meet a person for 5 minutes, exchange two sentences with him and know what kind of person he is. It&rsquo;s uncanny. I&rsquo;ve never known him to be wrong. I have found it in my interest to blindly follow his advice about people. And even more striking is his ability to find solutions by instantly simplifying a complex situation. Now, modesty apart, I have a healthy respect for my own abilities in this regard, but Piyush leaves me open mouthed time and again. It is more than a talent he has. It is a genius.</p>

<p>Perhaps the two phrases that typify him most are &lsquo;woh mera dost hai&rsquo; and &lsquo;baaki main sambhaal loonga&rsquo;. I have been all over the world with him and he has a &lsquo;dost&rsquo; everywhere. From Chairmen of rival agency groups to Vietnamese restaurateurs in Cannes, media group owners in Mumbai to Indian Ambassadors in Tokyo. He knows them all. They beam with genuine pleasure when they see him, hug him and invite him home for meals.</p>

<p>One cannot even imagine the pressure under which Piyush functions. Every client wants a piece of him. Even the smallest local clients say &lsquo;Hume Piyush Ji se milna hai.&rsquo; He has meetings and seminars and media interviews to attend all the time. And yet he is sensitive to his colleague&rsquo;s work load. If he sees me struggling with multiple mandates he will say &lsquo;toh gaana likh baaki main sambhaal loonga&rsquo;. What wouldn&rsquo;t you do for a leader like that?</p>

<p>No discussion about Piyush is complete without an allusion to cricket. In 1998 Mark Taylor, the Australian test captain was playing against Pakistan in Peshawar. He was on 334, equalling the highest individual score by an Australian set by none other than the legendary Don Bradman. Taylor declared his innings closed at 334 saying that now &lsquo;my name will always be connected to the Don&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Many didn&rsquo;t get it, but I understand perfectly. Even if I walk away from advertising today I will have no regrets whatsoever. I was part of the Pulse Polio campaign with Piyush Pandey. My name will always be connected to The Don&rsquo;s.</p>

      <article><p><p>Ashish Chakravarty has returned to McCann as Executive Director and Head of Creative, India.&nbsp;Chakravarty has been recognized as one of the top Creative Directors in India and has also been ranked among the top 50 ECDs in the world.</p>

<p>He was until recently, Chief Creative Officer of WPP&rsquo;s Contract, overseeing creative output of Contract Advertising, iContract, Designsutra, and Core Consulting. In his earlier stint at McCann India he closely worked with Prasoon Joshi and helped build McCann Delhi as one of the top leading operations in Delhi market. Winner of several national and international awards, he has also consistently been part of jury at various advertising awards.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Chakravarty will report directly&nbsp;to Prasoon Joshi, Chairman McCann Asia Pacific &amp; CEO &amp; CCO McCann Worldgroup India.</p>

<p>Speaking on the appointment, Prasoon Joshi, Chairman McCann Asia Pacific &amp; CEO &amp; CCO McCann Worldgroup India said &ldquo;Ashish is a rare breed of creative talent who is backed by solid strategic thinking. He&rsquo;s constantly rediscovering himself and genuinely interested in creating work with depth and effervescence at the same time. Moreover, he is a great team builder, am really looking forward to Ashish joining McCann back.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Commenting on his new role, Ashish&nbsp;Chakravarty said&nbsp;&ldquo;There is a certain degree of familiarity, and fondness that I have for McCann, having spent over a decade there. I enjoyed a fabulous run in my last stint, and it always felt good to see it continue from strength to strength. On a personal note, I have a huge regard for Prasoon, both as a creative leader, and for the person that he is. Our bond runs deep, and we have a quirky chemistry of sorts; one that is maddening, and magical at the same time. And almost always results in some very good work.&nbsp;So, when the opportunity came to get back into the thick of it, and also in a more substantial way than before, I found it hard to resist.&rdquo;</p></p><header><h1>Ashish Chakravarty returns to McCann as Executive Director & Creative Head, India</h1>

Just before the moment of truth, however, industry leaders share their top picks on who they think is the most deserving winner among the nine nominees this year.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:.0001pt; margin:0cm 0cm 8pt"><span style="font-family:Fira Sans;"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:normal"><span style="font-size:14.0pt">This year, the nominees for the award are Naveen Tewari, Founder and CEO, InMobi; Nadia Chauhan, Joint MD &amp; CMO, Parle Agro; Sanjay Gupta, Managing Director, Star India; Deepak Iyer, Managing Director, Mondelez India; Rajan Anandan, Vice President, South East Asia and India, Google; Ritesh Agarwal, Founder, Oyo; Sanjiv Mehta, Chairman &amp; MD, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL); Piyush Pandey, Executive Chairman and Creative Director, Ogilvy South Asia and Prasoon Pandey, Director, Corcoise Films; and Sriharsha Majeti, Rahul Jaimini, Nandan Reddy, Co-founders, Swiggy. &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

Also, all the nominees are super-achievers in their own right. This makes it very difficult to pick one name. However, there are two or three people who have done fabulous work for their organization. Sanjiv Mehta of HUL had a great turnover and great story this year. Sanjay Gupta of Star TV&nbsp;has played a key role in the Star TV&rsquo;s fabulous performance, with the acquisition of IPL, and the company that it has evolved into. I also think Nadia Chauhan is deserving because she&rsquo;s taken Parle Agro to a completely new level. </span></span></span></span></p>

It used to be a task thinking of a place you want to order your food from, but now whatever you want, you call Swiggy and you get it. In my family, Swiggy has had the biggest impact and if there are many families like that, then it has to be the biggest impact anyone has ever made. </span></span></span></span></p>

      <article><p><p>World-class cricket player, Mahendra Singh Dhoni, has partnered with Indi, a digital word of mouth engagement and monetisation platform, to extend and enhance relationships with his global fan base.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Indi platform will enable Dhoni&rsquo;s fans to become brand ambassadors for his Seven by MS Dhoni line of footwear, apparel and accessories while earning revenue on sales they generate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dhoni&rsquo;s reputation and ability to inspire 1.3 billion Indians has always amazed me. We are truly impressed with his motivation to give back to the fans who have given him so much. The chance to become a brand ambassador for Seven is a privilege indeed, and we are honored to be powering this groundbreaking opportunity for millions,&rdquo; said Indi CEO Neel Grover.</p>

<p>Seven by MS Dhoni offers a range of quality lifestyle and athletic apparel at affordable prices. Fans, athletes and gym goers find a unique range of daily wear to cricket-specific products ranging from cricket shoes to sweat-resistant tees. The latest technology, classic designs and highest quality materials are crafted into the Seven catalog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a special opportunity to be able to empower my fans and Seven by MS Dhoni customers with opportunities to not only engage with my label but to also increase their income by earning referral fees on sales they make across social media,&rdquo; Dhoni noted.</p>

<p>The Indi Brand Ambassador program for athletes offers a range of options for enhancing fan engagement including sponsorships, advertising, product recommendations, branded merchandise and two-way video on demand. The platform also provides detailed information on the athlete&rsquo;s Indi fan base, social traffic and income generation.</p>

<p>Another way athletes can engage their fans on Indi is through challenges where fans create and post videos and photos. Challenge winners are then selected based on criteria such as the &ldquo;best&rdquo; post and the most Indi Buzz generated by those posts.</p>

<p>Arun Pandey, Chairman and MD of Rhiti Group, stated, &ldquo;While we continue our aggressive push in growing the number of stores to 100 by end of this year, I am thrilled that we are in association with a leading brand like Indi in the digital space. I look forward to working with Indi.com and the founder&rsquo;s wealth of experience at such a promising time in India&rsquo;s e-commerce landscape to promote a healthy and fit lifestyle which Seven by MS Dhoni embodies.&rdquo;<br />

      <article><p><p>With digital being the growth driver for news, Asianetnews.com has emerged as a strong player in India&rsquo;s established legacy of news brands. The latest Comscore data has rated Asianetnews.com amongst the top 10 news platforms in India, with users spending an average time of 434 million minutes vis-a-vis 67 million minutes during the month of July earlier this year. This makes Asianetnews.com one of the fastest growing news platforms with close to 650% growth in average time spent by users. Also, the platform has seen a 400% growth in the average time spent per user, which has increased to 36 minutes from 9 minutes in July.</p>

<p>Asianetnews.com was already a market leader in South Indian languages and with the launch of bi-lingual media-tech platform Mynation.com in July this year, the platform has broken into the national English and Hindi digital news segment and has now emerged as the leading Indian news platform in vernacular languages.</p>

<p>Focused on creating a compelling digital video content platform, Asianet News Network&rsquo;s strong brand credibility and presence across the four southern states, with strong vernacular teams and deep regional insights, provides the group an edge to source and deliver content like none other.</p>

<p>Speaking on the development, Abhinav Khare, CEO, Asianetnews.com said, &ldquo;9 out of 10 new internet users in India will come from the vernacular segments. The craze for high-quality video content amongst our users is high which is why at Asianetnews.com, we focus on delivering vertical video content for our users. Other than focusing on Daily &amp; Monthly Active Users, we also focus on building high engagement, which led us to break into the top 10. Since major growth is coming from vernacular, we are confident that we will end the year in Top 5. Based on our aggressive organic and inorganic strategy, we will end the year with a base of 60 million monthly active users and monthly page views of 1 billion plus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shridhar Mishra, VP &ndash; Sales, Asianetnews.com said, &ldquo;This is an exciting time, we are going to generate a revenue growth of 250%+ over last year from India and Middle East Markets. We are working with Most top brands in the Entertainment, Auto, Telecom, Tech, Jewelry, Consumer Products, Real estate &amp; Building Material segments. On the Ad tech front, we are the first ones in the Regional Media space to implement Header bidding on our platforms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Amit Gupta, Managing Director, Asianet News Media &amp; Entertainment Pvt Ltd added, &ldquo;2018 has been a great year for Asianetnews.com. We are building deep domain expertise across board /languages and we are working on growing in-organically in Kannada, Telugu and verticals such as sports amongst others to further strengthen its position across all south languages in digital.&rdquo;</p></p><header><h1>Asianetnews.com breaks into the Top 10 news platforms in India</h1>

      <article><p><p>On World Toilet Day, Dentsu Impact, the creative agency from Dentsu Aegis Network, joined hands with We Are Water Foundation, CSR wing of Roca Bathroom Products Pvt. Ltd. to launch a movement that&rsquo;s getting everyone talking. This was a social experiment at Sector 29, Gurugram, Haryana for which, a makeshift public toilet was constructed. But when people went in to perform their ablutions, they were in for a surprise. They came face to face with a site, perhaps common to 250 million people in rural India &ndash; a railway track that&rsquo;s used as an open defecating area.</p>

<p>Children and women holding placards delivered the hard facts and adverse effects of open defecation. This not just shocked people but also sensitised them to the plight of rural India. Immediately, people pledged to #CloseOpenDefecation by signing up on the We Are Water Foundation portal. With each sign up/pledge, the foundation is contributing to the construction of more toilets.</p>

<p>The campaign has not been limited only to the social experiment. Prior to it, a film featuring the plight of rural India was launched on social media platforms along with teasers. This was followed up by the Social Experiment film and the option to pledge and tweet was extended to the online urban audience.</p>

<p>Ever since the movement, #CloseOpenDefecation has grabbed enough eyeballs and has trended at the no. 2 spot on Twitter for a day and has garnered 428k views so far.</p>

<p>Soumitra Karnik, Chief Creative Officer, Dentsu Impact says, &ldquo;As advertisers we must create communication which can assist the society we live in, in bringing about a positive change. As communication experts we can and should create content that delivers solutions that can impact a change in our society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mayuri Saikia, Management Trustee, We are Water Foundation India &amp; Marketing Head, Roca India says, &ldquo;The problem of open defecation has always been prevalent in the country and still 250 million rural Indians continue to defecate in the open exposing them to various disease and mishaps. Through We Are Water Foundation we have been promoting healthy living, better hygiene and improved sanitation in the country and have done some truly impactful work over the years. When the idea was presented to us, we saw immense potential in it. So far, we have received a heartwarming response for the campaign as more and more are joining the cause with the foundation. As corporates and individuals, we need to realise that beyond government initiatives, we have so much power to drive the desired behavioral change towards usage of toilets and work towards the common goal to #CloseOpenDefecation.&rdquo;</p>

The artistic representations help to show consumers that by looking beyond the ordinary they can unlock something special.</p>

<p>Lately, in India, achievers are getting younger and their world is getting busier. In their frantic struggle to the top, they are losing touch with emotions that are truly special in their lives. The Glenlivet, as a brand, aims to identify and celebrate these special emotions or moments that our target audience, senses a connection with. It is the distinct character of such emotions that inspires The Glenlivet to tell a story of an inimitable bond between two people, and a deep-rooted memory that still plays vividly in one&rsquo;s mind, through this endearing and culturally true campaign.</p>

<p>Kartik Mohindra, Chief Marketing Officer, Pernod Ricard India said, &ldquo;The Glenlivet campaign has been designed to celebrate THE moments, which allow us to lead richer and more fulfilling lives. Given how the young achievers are graduating to finer things in life, it was time, we welcomed them to the world of The Glenlivet. Our latest campaign reiterates that in a world with an oversupply of everything- glut, plenitude &amp; noise, what we need is those definitive moments and the Three letter word &ldquo;The&rdquo;, an iconic &amp; distinctive symbol, reinforces the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Commenting on the launch, Miriam Eceolaza, Marketing Director, The Glenlivet said, &ldquo;The Glenlivet campaign is our most ambitious to date. It&rsquo;s a modern and contemporary campaign that stays true to our heritage. India is a key market for The Glenlivet, and we have created this specific campaign to celebrate some of life&rsquo;s definitive moments of the Indian consumer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Janmenjoy Mohanty, Regional President-North &amp; East, Lowe Lintas India said, &ldquo;Sometimes the most impactful way to put across the brand message is through good old story telling. We chose the most endearing stories that celebrate definitive emotions in an individual&rsquo;s life. Each one has been painstakingly crafted with a fine mix of stunning visuals, underplayed emotions and music that talks to the soul. We hope each of these stories manage to touch a chord with our target audience.&quot;<br />
Conceptualised for the Indian market, the campaign has been launched in India, and will be followed by a global release and will be promoted across multimedia platform.</p>

      <article><p><p>Ex-Facebook India MD, Kirthiga Reddy, announced in a Facebook post that she will join SoftBank Investment Advisers as their first venture partner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reddy resigned from her position as Facebook India&rsquo;s Managing Director in 2016. After which she went back to the US to explore new opportunities at Facebook&rsquo;s headquarters in Menlo Park.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After over seven incredible years at Facebook &mdash; starting as the first employee and managing director for Facebook India and the last two years at HQ as managing global client partner and emerging markets lead &mdash; I am thrilled to join SoftBank Investment Advisers as their first venture partner,&rdquo; Reddy said in her Facebook post.</p>

<p>Reddy is known for her technical and business expertise &ndash; from both enterprise and consumer technology, in developed and emerging markets. At SoftBank, she will be based out of the San Carlos, Silicon Valley office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I look forward to contributing to their mission to positively shape the future by seeking to back the boldest, most transformative and optimistic ideas of today. Like in other investment firms, the venture partner role enables quick integration of new talent from non-investing backgrounds, which is a perfect fit for me,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>According to media reports, Reddy in her new role will be working closely with SoftBank Investment Advisors on frontier technologies &ndash; AI, robotics, health tech, bioengineering, semis, IoT, quantum computing, and more &ndash; with an aim to enable the next stage of the information revolution.</p>

<p>Post Reddy&rsquo;s resignation, Facebook appointed Umang Bedi as Facebook India head, who resigned in October 2017, just over a year after he joined the social media company. After another year of search, Facebook has now appointed Hotstar CEO Ajit Mohan as MD and VP of Facebook India. Mohan is expected to join the company early next year.<br />

      <article><p><p dir="ltr">Early October, Direct to Home (DTH) operator Tata Sky removed SPNI&#39;s 22 channels along with TV Today Network&rsquo;s channels which were officially distributed by SPNI.</p>

<p dir="ltr">SPNI spokesperson confirmed the news and said, &ldquo;Yes, the Sony Pictures Networks channels are back on Tata SKy&rdquo;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The operator had faced a lot of backlash by its subscribers on social media after removing the broadcaster&#39;s channels. Tata Sky requested its subscribers to bear with them and assured that they are committed to working in the interest of its subscribers.</p>

<p dir="ltr">&ldquo;Commercial negotiations with the broadcasters broke down as what they were seeking would have forced us to hike our prices. Hence we have had to drop a few channels while keeping the popular ones on.

      <article><p><p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The Saregama Carvaan is 55-year-old Archana Singh&rsquo;s primary music listening device. She listens to bhajans in the morning and evergreen melodies of the 60s and 70s while having her evening tea. Last Diwali her children gifted it to her and her husband. And over the past year, Carvaan has become her prized possession. What&rsquo;s more, Singh&rsquo;s friends who have experienced Carvaan at her home have also bought the portable music player.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Scepticism was rife 16 months ago when legacy music licencing company Saregama (erstwhile HMV) announced the launch of its digital music player that resembled an old fashioned radio. Who would pay to buy a device that stores 5,000 songs when everything is freely available on sites like YouTube, most&nbsp;wondered. But people like Archana Singh and her friends are testimony to the consumer insight that drove Saregama to rethink how people listen to music.&nbsp;People wanted a device that is convenient to use. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Positioned for people in the 40-plus age bracket, Carvaan delivers a lean-back listening experience in a world where people need to proactively create playlists of their liking and decide what song they want to listen to next.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The scepticism about a product like Carvaan stems from people, and sometimes even marketers, getting stuck inside an echo chamber of people just like them. The success of Saregama Carvaan teaches marketers to never lose touch of the needs of the end consumer.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Vikram Mehra, Managing Director of Saregama Carvaan, says, &ldquo;As marketers we start thinking that the whole of India or the world is like us. It need not be so. There are a large number of people in this country who still want things that are comfortable.&rdquo; He says that marketers must not lose touch with what the end consumer wants. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Calling Saregama Carvaan unique and unconventional, brand guru Saurabh Uboweja said, &ldquo;This is a simple product that is packaged around a need that was not serviced.&rdquo; At a time when all marketers are chasing the millennials, &ldquo;Carvaan targeted a market that is largely ignored by brands,&rdquo; Uboweja pointed out.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Mehra said he was surprised to learn that people thought that Saregama was not sharing its huge library of music even though all the songs from the Saregama stable were available on all leading streaming platforms and YouTube for free. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Consumer research also revealed that the fear of technology gets stronger among people as they age. In addition to the 40+ demographic from non-metro cities and towns, Saregama spoke to people in the 65+ age group in Mumbai to learn their sentiments. They asked this group of people what they feared the most; the response the company was expecting was &ldquo;dying.&rdquo; Instead, this urban group said what it feared the most was &ldquo;being dependent on children.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Armed with this consumer insight, the company set out with a clear vision to create a product for people who grew up listening to iconic singers like Lata Mangeshkar, Asha Bhonsle, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh, and Mohd. Rafi. Positioning typically defines the target audience for a product. &ldquo;It is also important to know who we are not positioned for,&rdquo; says Mehra. He and his team is not targeting this product for a 21-year-old and they are clear about it.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The Saregama team designed Carvaan to have a familiar user interface that triggers nostalgia. In the early version of the Carvaan, the buttons were activated on touch. &ldquo;People got back saying with touch they were not sure of having pressed the button. So in the later models we introduced mechanical buttons,&rdquo; explains Mehra.&nbsp;Nostalgia-inspired products like Paper Boat&rsquo;s drinks have been making a comeback in a huge way. Tapping into the nostalgia element through design and the selection of music has been a winning strategy for Carvaan and helped the product gain entry into the living rooms of people.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">The latest version of the product is also large in size because of the feedback that some perceived the product to be fragile. Mehra lifts the metallic Carvaan Gold to prove that it is light, though the appearance of the product makes it look robust.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><img alt="" src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1544069291_XKwTG2_units-sold.jpg" /></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">All the attributes of the Saregama Carvaan, including its creative communication that positions it as a gift that youngsters can give their parents and grandparents have hit the right notes. The product has sold one million units since its launch and contributes to nearly half of Saregama&rsquo;s music revenue. The company has just scratched the surface of its potential market size - 25 million homes.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><img alt="" src="https://cms.exchange4media.com/files/1544069213_8OQLu4_music-share.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 345px;" /></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Mehra could not be more proud of the product and what it stands for. &ldquo;Biggest feather in our cap is that we not just created a new product but a new category and new concept that too from a brand that is not into retail.&rdquo; As per Saregama&rsquo;s internal studies, Carvaan is played for around 7.5 hours on average every day in a home where there is at least one person above the age of 60. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">Mehra says that Carvaan will see many further iterations as feedback flows back into the company. He reiterates that the core insight that made Carvaan a success will always inform every stage of development. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:0cm; margin-left:0cm"><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif">&ldquo;Carvaan is not just giving music but memories connected to music along with the convenience of listening to music,&rdquo;&nbsp;he says. </span></span></p></p><header><h1>Saregama Carvaan: A lesson in listening to the consumer</h1>

      <article><p><p>TikTok is a short video sharing app where users can watch and create quick videos. Earlier this year, popular sister app Musical.ly was merged to it. Founded in 2012, TikTok is one of the country&rsquo;s fastest-growing tech start-ups and is known for its use of algorithms and artificial intelligence to select videos and other features.</p>

<p>In an interview with exchange4media, Raj Mishra, Business Head, TikTok India, spoke about the app, how the brand keeps its creators engaged, product innovations and more.</p>

<p><strong>Edited Excerpts:</strong></p>

<p><strong>How is TikTok planning to strengthen its leadership position in India?</strong><br />
Our mission is to capture and present creativity, knowledge and moments that matter. TikTok enables everyone to be a creator and encourages users to share their passion and creative expression through their videos.</p>

<p>What enhances the experience is TikTok&rsquo;s &lsquo;For You&rsquo; feed. It offers personalised recommendations to users according to their viewing preferences. The content is curated in a way that instead of serving up videos from only the popular users on the platform, users also get recommendations of video content shared by regular users of the app. With this feature, TikTok is enabling more users to find success in being a creator on the platform and reaching new, global audience.</p>

<p><strong>Why was Musical.ly merged to TikTok when it was already popular among audience?</strong><br />
Through TikTok, we want to capture the world&rsquo;s creativity and knowledge and remind everyone to treasure every precious life moment. Combining musical.ly and TikTok was a natural fit, given the shared mission of both the experiences. TikTok not only ensures that the content shared is localised, based on the users viewing patterns and interest, but at the same time allows all users to showcase their talent in front of a larger, global audience.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is the core business model of TikTok? Are you majorly dependent on monetization? If yes, then how are you looking to strengthen it?</strong><br />
Currently our focus is on making our app better than before and creating engaging content for our users. We want to continuously provide fresh, novel features on TikTok and ensure that our users have an excellent in-app experience.</p>

<p><strong>How are artificial intelligence and machine learning helping you in sorting content according to consumer demand? Any plans to come up with new product innovations?</strong><br />
TikTok incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) technology that has global applications and provides unique in-app features, thus allowing users to enjoy unique and personalised experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;AI technology enables video and image recognitions. Users can make short format videos within minutes, and share them with their friends and fans on the app. At TikTok, our advanced machine learning algorithms are constantly optimising and personalising content feeds for our users. This allows us to customize content feeds based on individual preferences and deliver new content based on topics and trends users find most interesting. We are working on enhancing the user experience further and to innovate ourselves to ensure we stay relevant.</p>

<p><strong>TikTok is one of the most downloaded apps of 2018, but internet security experts warn that it is not appropriate for young users. What are you doing to change this notion, as it can seriously affect the business of the brand?</strong><br />
Apart from ensuring best user experience, privacy and protection are of utmost importance to us. We are committed to maintaining a safe in-app atmosphere for our vibrant and creative user community. We have recently launched a new safety centre and have robust community guidelines in place which provide tips and resources to help users navigate through a range of topics and build a safe online experience.</p>

<p>Overall, our priority is to promote a positive environment that allows our users to showcase their talent on a global platform. We have also implemented a moderation technology based on an algorithm and a robust human team. The moderation team, based on the expansive community guidelines, ensures the digital wellbeing of our users.</p>

<p><strong>How do you consider India as a market in terms of business and how much of your content is localised for Indian audience?</strong></p>

<p>India is an important market for us, given the presence of a vibrant user base. In addition to TikTok being a global platform, we are dedicated to bringing in the localised user experience regardless of which market we operate in.</p>

<p>Our localisation strategy helps us in encouraging users to create relevant and local content along with incorporating global trends in localized flavour. Our operations team is in sync with the market needs to ensure that TikTok provides the best community support for creativity and discovery for our local users.</p>

<p>As part of our journey to discover and provide a platform to showcase creativity, we are continuously working towards improving the user experience and delivering a more diverse and compelling content.</p></p><header><h1>Our motive is to provide localised user experience: Raj Mishra, TikTok</h1>

    <body>
      <article><p><p>WhatsApp India recently launched its first ever TV campaign called &lsquo;Share Joy, Not Rumours&rsquo; as the latest step in a comprehensive effort to address the challenge of misinformation and pernicious rumours.</p>

<p>WhatsApp worked closely with the Mumbai agency Taproot Dentsu and the filmmaker Shirsha Guha Thakurta to develop three sixty second films that each convey real scenarios about rumours that have spread on WhatsApp via spam as well as in family and school groups. Each film&#39;s protagonist teaches someone important in their lives to not spread rumours and to use WhatsApp controls such as the ability to block senders and leave groups where rumours are spread. We chatted with Neeraj Kanitkar, Creative Director, Taproot Dentsu to understand what went behind conceptualizing the brand&rsquo;s first-ever TVC.</p>

<p>Kanitkar shared that given that WhatsApp has never done an integrated TVC campaign anywhere in the world, this was a thrilling opportunity. He revealed that while conceptualising the campaign, they took a conscious call to not paint indiscriminate forwarders as offenders. &ldquo;Since often, the vast majority of people who forward such messages do it without intending any malice. If they can be convinced to be skeptical about forwarding messages then our hope was that those with malicious intent would be deprived of the oxygen. &ldquo;</p>

<p>Kanitkar exclaimed that the process of making the films was a real treat. &ldquo;We shot across Delhi and Mumbai, sometimes with real families with almost no acting experience to play key roles, and they did a great job!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Expert eye</strong></p>

<p>Praveen Nair, Creative Director, Jack in the Box Worldwide opines that while it is a great intent shown by the brand to address a very prevalent problem that plagues the society, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. &ldquo;In masking the communication under the goodness of sharing, the brand has missed an opportunity to drive home an important message. Yes, it does explain how positively this messaging platform can be used, but has it brought to fore the impact of its misuse? The only question to ask is... is this campaign powerful enough to initiate a change in behaviour, in this case, a tendency to share things ignorantly and irresponsibly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Faisal Haq, VP - Operations (North), WATConsult opines that it finally seems that all roads are leading not just only towards 2019 but 2019 general elections&hellip; &ldquo;Just before Rajasthan and Telangana state elections Facebook-owned company WhatsApp have released three one-minute films in nine different languages and with this it is not just conceding but trying to crackdown spread of fake news and rumours on its platform.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Haq terms it as &ldquo;a well-crafted campaign that not just apogee various scenarios we usually deal on daily basis on different WhatsApp personal and profession groups but how to understand the impact and act wisely with the fake news and rumours by talking to the source sending these messages.&rdquo; He likes that the campaign also highlights the app features like remove the user spreading these fake news or leave/delete the group if need be. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Says Rohan Patil, AVP - Client Servicing, Geometry Encompass, &ldquo;With great art direction, the ad has been produced in a lovely manner putting the message across not only seamlessly, but also with such simplicity. Great work WhatsApp! We needed this link (especially my dad), and has been shared on my Family group.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rajeesh Rajagopalan, Mumbai Head, Grapes Digital remarks that the campaign works as it&#39;s straight to the point and does that without being preachy. &ldquo;It communicates the thought beautifully, in a manner that&#39;s easy to understand, considering the audience is across age groups, geographies and social strata. And, at the same time it&#39;s entertaining enough to hold the audience for a minute. Fake messages are a serious issue, and any campaign that addresses social issues usually face the challenge of being boring and dry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Deepak Singh, CCO, YAAP is of the opinion that being the first-ever ad from Whatsapp, which is a cult brand amongst the youth, he expected more from it in terms of story-telling. &ldquo;It is a little too explanatory right now. The execution per se is fine. The characters chosen, the college setting, everything fits the scenario well. But I feel they could have played around with the story and concept to a slightly larger extent,&rdquo; Singh says. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

Before rebranding as Dailyhunt in 2015, our revenue came from content sales in the form of e-books and other small content pieces. We have been continuously investing in technology so that we can provide higher CTRs and flow-through&nbsp;rates for advertisers. We recently launched our self-serve advertising platform in Beta, which will help small businesses to grow. In the next 18 months, we plan to triple our user base; double the time spent and release five times more inventory, which we are looking to monetize in a big way through video advertising. At present, Dailyhunt has 157 million MAUs,&nbsp;we are poised to hit the 250 million users mark by June 2019. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

Additionally, we also follow a publisher rating system, from views and feedback on whether the content is disturbing, or the imagery wasn&rsquo;t accurate. We create a score, which is calibrated in real time for each publisher, and we transparently share that feedback with the publisher to differentiate real news from the fake easily.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Most Indians access the Internet via their mobile devices. However, in a country of 1.35 billion people, there are only 400 million smartphones. The growth of smartphones must happen much faster. The macro ecosystem challenge of adding more and more smartphones must be dealt with on priority. And, the second challenge is that we must continue to have more locally relevant content, as people are attracted to content in their local languages.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

The report also states that 65-70 per cent of all advertising on online media will shift to vernacular, and we would find ourselves as the largest platform in that space. Therefore, we believe that&nbsp;our secret sauce truly lies in our ability to harness vernacular languages and yet build a scalable platform, which is supported by all the latest technologies. We would also focus our energies on adopting block chain technology and drive meaningful, personalized, intuitive experiences for local language audiences.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

      <article><p><p>Storia Foods &amp; Beverages, a budding entrepreneurial venture in the natural foods space, has set its sight on establishing a firm grip in the Indian food market with its multiple offerings. To give flight to its much-coveted dream, the company has roped in Publicis Beehive to manage its entire communications mandate.</p>

<p>The agency was shortlisted after a multi-agency pitch and will manage the entire communication mandate including advertising, brand activation, digital and media. The agency was chosen for articulating a sharp and forward-looking communication plan that seeks to establish Storia Foods as the go-to brand for its multiple natural offerings.</p>

<p>A relatively new entrant in the natural foods arena, what makes Storia Foods a brand to watch out for is its commitment to creating products that are natural, full of goodness and promote a healthy lifestyle. It is driven by the philosophy that food is much more than a means to sustain life; it is a means of sharing, caring and bringing people together. Storia finds its roots in celebrating these moments of togetherness and turning moments into bonds of a lifetime.</p>

<p><em>Vishal Shah &ndash; Founder &amp; Managing Partner, Storia Foods &amp; Beverages</em></p>

<p>Sharing his viewpoint on his plans for the Indian market and also on appointing Publicis Beehive as its communications partner, Vishal Shah &ndash; Founder &amp; Managing Partner, Storia Foods &amp; Beverages said: &ldquo;It is important that we have a deep understanding of our consumers, how we want our consumers to perceive us and what feeling we want to leave them with. Today&rsquo;s society is moving rapidly and brands have a small window to interact with their consumers and create an impact through their products and communication. It was thus important for Storia to invest in a partner who could communicate these brand values and create a feeling of belonging for our consumers and Publicis Beehive fit the bill seamlessly. They understand our brand vision and culture and there is immense trust that they will nurture our brand as well as we do.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>Paritosh Srivastava, COO &ndash; Publicis Beehive</em></p>

<p>Expressing a similar sentiment, Paritosh Srivastava, COO &ndash; Publicis Beehive said: &ldquo;Partnering an upcoming and entrepreneurial brand like Storia Foods &amp; Beverages presents both an opportunity as well as a challenge. Opportunity lies in leveraging our integrated strength to put our best foot forward in terms of creative, media, digital and activation. The challenge is the trust and responsibility entrusted by Vishal and team upon us to make Storia a success in a tough environment. It&rsquo;s a great product and we hope that together we will create memorable communication that will result in disproportionate trials and awareness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As a new-age brand, Storia lays great emphasis on making products that are healthy and natural. There are absolutely no artificial colours or artificial flavours added. Instead, all products are made in a way to keep them as close to their natural state as possible, while also ensuring that there is a minimum loss of nutrients in the process. What consumers end up with is a healthy, natural and wholesome product that they are better together with.</p>

<p>The agency is currently working on the first communication message which will be rolled out shortly.</p></p><header><h1>Storia Foods awards integrated communications mandate to Publicis Beehive</h1>

      <article><p><p><span style="font-family:Fira Sans;">India&rsquo;s beloved ad-man Piyush Pandey was <a href="https://www.exchange4media.com/announcements-news/ogilvy-appoints-piyush-pandey-as-its-global-cco-93292.html">named Global CCO of Ogilvy </a>effective January 1, 2019, on Wednesday. He becomes the first Indian to take up the role of a worldwide chief creative officer.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>On the appointment of Pandey, John Seifert, Chief Executive, Ogilvy Worldwide, said, &ldquo;We could not be more thrilled that Piyush will be serving as our Chief Creative Officer, Worldwide and my creative partner. &nbsp;Piyush is a true industry icon who is uniquely suited to lead our global creative efforts. Creativity has and will always be at the heart of the Ogilvy brand and culture. Piyush is the perfect leader to shepherd that legacy as we continue to focus on making brands matter as the leading creative network in the world.</p>

<p><span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Fira Sans;">Pandey entered the advertising industry in 1982 at a time when television ads were gaining popularity and Hindi was becoming a medium of communication on television. Pandey infused advertising with a unique Indian flavour, picking up on the most delicate behavioural, cultural, and emotional nuances of the Indian consumer. He is credited with revolutionising advertising in India by breaking away from Western and English influences.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Fira Sans;">Growing up in a family that exposed him to the beauty of Hindi literature, poetry, and music, shaped Pandey&rsquo;s creative instincts. His father loved Hindi literature and poetry and held poetry recitals at the Pandey household regularly. &ldquo;Just being in the house, around my father, I became a lover of poetry,&rdquo; Pandey writes in his book Pandeymonium. He calls his mother the creative director of the factory he grew up in and credits his mother for the inculcating the love for reading and writing in him. Pandey&rsquo;s love for the Hindi language and music stems from his sisters.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Fira Sans;">Over the last 35 years, Pandey has influenced creative minds and shaped the Indian creative advertising industry. He is the most illustrious and globally renowned advertising personality from India. Anyone who has lived through the&nbsp;&#39;90s in India remembers the iconic Fevicol, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Asian Paints, and later, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh tourism ads that were crafted by him.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Fira Sans;">Pandey has won many international awards over the last 35 years. Earlier this year he along with his brother Prasoon Pandey became the first Indians to receive the <a href="https://www.exchange4media.com/advertising-news/piyush-pandeyprasoon-pandey-to-receive-cannes-lions-lifetime-achievement-award-in-2018-87596.html">Lion of Saint Mark Award for Lifetime Achievement</a>. It is Cannes Lions&rsquo; highest honour for legends in the communications industry.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Fira Sans;">He won his first two Gold Lions for an anti-smoking ad that featured a Marlboro Man lookalike with a dead horse. Unofficially, he worked with brother Prasoon Pandey on Ericsson Cellphone&rsquo;s One Black Coffee ad which is the first Indian campaign to win at Cannes in 1996.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Fira Sans;">Pandey was the first Asian to be a jury president at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, in 2004. He received the Lifetime Achievement Award from The Advertising Agencies Association of India (AAAI) in 2010. In 2012 he was awarded the CLIO Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2016 he became the first person in advertising to receive the Padma Shri.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:Fira Sans;">Pandey will take charge of leading the creative team at what is called the oldest advertising agency in the world on January 1, 2019. He will lead Ogilvy&rsquo;s 100 offices based while being based in&nbsp;India - a place he calls a storyteller&rsquo;s factory. &nbsp;</span></span></p></p><header><h1>Another first for Piyush Pandey, only Indian to become a Global CCO</h1>
